ing in hie own words the inner heart of the great

Pontiff, might well seem indispeneable.
To the edueated man who still retains some interest

in the classic rhythmo of hie collegiate atudy, such a

volume should appeal with special force, as it furnishes
a pleasant illustration of modern themee dressed out in

the diction of Virgil and Horace. The Pope hae used
many metree——hexameters, pentameters‚ iambie di-
meters, hendecasyllabiee‚ Sapphica, Aloaioe, the elegiae
couplet, and Ambrosian quantitative etanzaa

The poeme are arranged chronologically, and thus

beoome a versified commentary, ae delightful ae it ie
anthemio, on the marvel of the Pope'e life and labore.

The volume contains an ample Appendix of Notes—
hietorioal, critical, exegetical.
