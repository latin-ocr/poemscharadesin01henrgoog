ΟΝ HIS SICKNESS
(1830)

Α YOUTH of twenty years—how sickly and how spate!
Ah, ιο what natural shocks my flesh is heir!

Haply ιο utter here my memorable grief,
May bring, if not surcease, some sad relief.

Through sleepless nights in vain I fretfully compose
My weak and weary limbs ιο seek repose.

My food no strength affords3 my drooping lids complain
Of light 3 and oft my head is racked with pain.

Anon my parched limbs a wasting ague chius,
Anon with torrid heats of sever fills.

Haggard and wan my face, and laboring is my brenth:
Languid I walk the way ιο dusty death.

Why shall I cheat my heart, and years a-plenty orave
When Atropos compels the dreaded grave ’ἶ

Rather my soul will speak: “O Death, where is thy
With gladness I await. thy triumphing1 [sting?

⁴‘ The passing shows of life shall not disturb my peace,
Who long ιο taste the joy that cannot cease.

“ Happy the exile’s feet ιο prees the Fatherland 3

Happy the storm-tossed bark ιο gain the strand 1”
