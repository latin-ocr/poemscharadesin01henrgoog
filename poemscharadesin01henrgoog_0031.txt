OHA RADES

LAC-RIMA ¹

1 DRANK the first, my friend,
And phthisis had an end.

But with the nm, my boat
Must oease, at last, to float.

The whole your eyes have known,
Your pallid oheeks have shown;
For oh l the swelling tide

No bravest beart could hide,
When your dear mother died.

(stanslation of Italian paraphrm)

My face was gaunt, my breath was soant3
A subtle poison stealing slowly
Through all my limbs did strength supplent
With weakness and with melancholy:
But when I drank my first, dear Lovatello‚
I felt renewed‚ and quite another fellow!

How lightly on the swelling deep
My little boat was nimbly dancing,
While voice and oar with rhythmio sweep
Weleomed the shore so near advanoing:
So near, and yet so far 1 Alam, we reokoned
Without our host-our bark had sprung a second!

Ι see my whole bedim your eye ;

For when you lost your dearest mother,
Your dewy oheek could not belie

The grief you vainly sought to smother.
Ah, friend, it is the witness of a sorrow
That from no human help suroease may borrow.
