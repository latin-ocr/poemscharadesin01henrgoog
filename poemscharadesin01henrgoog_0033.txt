CHARADES

ARTI—GIANO ¹

THE sport of rude barbarian hordes,
From their beloved nest

In Greece, of old my first strayed far
As exiles, sore distressed.

Tin dear Ausonia's laughing fields
Beheld the wanderers come,

And on her hospitable soil
Build an enduring home.

Here were uplift their graeeful heads,
Here shone their splendors old:
Vainly the stranger sought to win
The heritage we hold.
But tell me, Silvia, if he still
Seareh vainly‚ as he roves
Beside the Arno' s classic stream
In green Italian groves ‘3

My second, King of Latium, held
His throne long years ago:
Next Umbria, then Etruria came
His lawe benign to know;
For (if it be no mythic tale
The ancient writers tell)
A people happy, blithe, content,
Wisely he ruled and well.
