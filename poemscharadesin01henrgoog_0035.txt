'rho Romans held him as a god‚¹
Whose valor could unlock
The portale of the dreaded shrine
On the Tarpeian rock.
Patron of peace, his imagee
Were piously displayed '
Where money-lenders in the mart
Securely plied their trade.

He toils and sweats and watches long,
And racks his weary head

How he may win for wife and child
A scanty loaf of bread.

Yet is he happy ; for no shapes
of guilt beset his way:

In peace with God and man he wile,
Singing the livelong day.
