SYLVIA, the glory and the boast
Of all Italia's fairest,

An English bard thy beauty sang,
And made thy fame tho meet.

1, too, would offer thee a gift—
A little rhymic flower
Plucked in its grassy bower

Beside my gurdon-brock.

ΙΙ.

Hie to the thick Idalian wood,
And in its leafy tangle
Follow the foamy steed whose reins
In useless guidimce dangle:
My ,ᾔτει is there. Diana-like,
Pursue with heavy quiver
And footsteps fleeting ever,
The boar and bounding deor.
