OHA RADES

ΙΙΙ.
To bards of old the Delian god

Gave richly of my secorid,
And plumed their pinions for the flight
Where fame and genius beckoned:
Ah, could Ι share their plenteous gift,
Up to the ether winging
A song more worth the singing

Would leap from this poor lyre Ι

IV.

Osiers and rushes intertwined
Make up my riddle wholly ,-
’Τ is humblest work of women's hands—
Yet deem it not too lowly:
Behold‚ its hollow 1 have filled
With many a fruit and flower‚
To make it, for thy bomar,
Sylvia, a pleasant gift!
