CHARA DES

SOL-FANELLO ¹
(π tlte sama)
ssEHoLl), the heaven glows
With starry light,
While earth and sea repose
In shades of night.

My first ascende—each hill
Is ridged with gold ;
The flowers new sweets distil,

New eharms unfold.

My second then in gray
And crimson elad,
Offers an artless lay,
A ehirping glad.

Again ’t is evening dun:
Strike on the head

My whole, for now the sun
Hae gone to bed!

ι) Sovoeoeao amntem Sol(e)=sun; Ματο- unnet.
