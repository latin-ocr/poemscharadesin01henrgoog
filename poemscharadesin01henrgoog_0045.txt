POEMS

TO MONSIGNOR ORFEI ¹

(1838)

ORPHEUS, ’t is said, with melting lay
Could soothe the beasts of prey,

And lead them forth of brake and brier,
Sequacious of the lyre.

Doee not his power again unfold
The magio wrought of old ‘3

Does not hie spirit still inflame
The tace that bears his name?

Well might I eredit such a thing,
Hearing our Orpheus sing

And launeh from his reeounding lyre
Shafts of melodia fire!

Alack1 a silly dove bath flown
Hither from Adria'e zone3

Why, in our ehimney stands confessed
His birdling's raucone nest!

Ι) Mons. orfei, the predecessor of Mons. Peeoi in the Legation of Bene·
vento, had aenigned a part of the Apostouc palaea. ealled the Ounno, to the
Prouident or the court, Palomba, ο, lawyer from Loretto.
