POEMS

TO FULVIO BELLELIO ¹

(1841)

M ESEEMS a zephyr, strayed from Paradise,
Breathee from the rosee blooming on your eheek ;
Your winning smile‚ your courtesy antique,

Bind every heart to you in loving ties,

But when the lightning flaehes from your eyes,

And angry clouds your snowy foreheafl seek‚

And from your mouth the red-lipped thunders
How blanchee every face in dread eurmisel [speak—

Thou oracleet what path the world should take,
Ο Bard, and Seer, and Orator of youth:
Surely such genius should the earth forsake l

spread then your pinions for the flight: good sooth,
You will not sear the venom-epitting snake,
The laughing mob, or mordant Envy'e tooth.

1)Δ oonoeited ronow who osten boasted of his good looks md tockoned
himselfa philosopher, an orator, and a man of letters.
