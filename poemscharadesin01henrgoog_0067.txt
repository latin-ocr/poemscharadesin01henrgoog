POEMS

TO GALLUS ¹

(1870)

WHAT madness, Gallus 1 Ah, what profits it
To drown in pleasure's bath thy saner wit?

Scarce had the down of youth o'erspread ὼγ cheek,
Tin Chloe's love thy sinful beart would eeek.

Then Byce, then Corynna‚ thy desire;
And daily smarts ὼγ wound with deeper fire.

Not even thy whitening hairs the passion cloak
That fiings thee groveling 'neath Nigella's yoke.

Where shall it end *Ρ Riee from the filthy mire,
Break the sad chain, and cleanse ὼγ foul attire.

Thou dalliest, loving still ὼγ cruel chains ¹?
Alae 1 what hope of safety then remains? ⁴

Lo 1 at ὼγ side the Demon waits his prey‚
And Death is summoning to the J udgment Dayl

ι) Meant for a certain citizen or Perugia, whom the Binhop hul been long
trying to reform.
