POEMS

RECOURSE TO THE VIRGIN

m ‘rm‘mnou ¹
(1871 )

WHEN with purpose foul
The malignant Devil

Breathes upon ὼγ soul
Pestilential evil:

And ὼγ spirit fair
Clouds of horror darken,

To thy tenderent prayer
Bid the Virgin hem-ken.

On ὼγ blushing cheek

Let the tear-drop glistem
Say: “ O Mother meek‚

To ὼγ client listen !''

Let the suppliant sigh
Swell to deeper wailing:
‘⁴ Mother sweet, I fly
To thy love unfailing:

“Heir 8111 Ι of bliss

And of glory deathles53
Oh, remembering this,

Let me not prove faithless:

“ Let me never yield

To the shameless Dex'ril:
Mary‚ be my shield

’Gainst the darts of evil !''
