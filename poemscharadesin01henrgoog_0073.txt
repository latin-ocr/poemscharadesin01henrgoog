OR if my words should please, or if they serve, belike,
From auvil of thy soul new sparks of fire to atrike,

Rotelli, pray accept my praise so merited—
My wishes that presago new glories for thy head!

Whilst thou dost mourn with team cmunm’s sainting
And tenderly bewail his unrelenting death3 [δι-θεὼ,

And then with learned art his splendid virtue scau,
His piety, and all the merite of the man :—

His grave, majestic port who-n at the Altar found,
And the white, reverend hairs with mitred glory crowned;

And the dear soul benign, and the high-gifted hem-t,
And venerable face sweetened by grace and art:

¹ A man ot eminent virtue, genius sud eloquenee. and nector ot tho Um-
vemty of Perusia st 1878).
