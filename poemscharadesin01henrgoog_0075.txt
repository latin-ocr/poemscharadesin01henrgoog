POEMS

So dost thou picture him, with eloquenee divine,
As none more loved might be in all the priestly line.

Enraptnmi, every ear drinks in thy words of gold,
And every eye is strained thy magio to behold!

But me a. sweeter thought, a blander joy euml-alls,
And all my beart leaps up, as memory recalls

How soon within my heart thy love did entrance seek,
When springtime of thy life wakod roses in thy eheek3

And how twin gleaming stare lit up thy face so fain
And how ὼγ nimble feet sought plen-sance everywhere ς

And how with joy I said: “ Advanee to man’s estate,
And whither genius leads plu-sue, and ehallenge Fatel

From the Pierian sky may the sweet Muse eome down
And with Apollo's wreath thy dearer forehead erownl

Be thou the envious boant of both scholastica arte—
The one that reckone space, the one that capturee hearte:

And when the flowing years maturet power bring,
Drink deep and deeper draughts of Wisdom’s plenteous
spnng:

Learn from her ample storo to suffer, dare, and die—-

And with exalted brow touch the remotest sky! '’
