MY deareet LouiS, ecion of a race
Famous for noble deede, who bear'st the traee

Of mighty ancestry‚¹ prythee receive
The cordial prayers and greetings that Ι give.

For Pms, Shepherd of the Fold, to thee
Hath given a more exalted ministry:

Skilful in lawe, and graced with many a gift,
He bide thee now the shepherd’s crozier list.

Rejoice‚ then, O ye hille that saw his youth
Grow strong in manliness and grace and truthl

Rejoice‚ Chietil Yet more gladly thou
Shalt weave a chaplet for thy shepherd'e brow.

But have a care, my friend! Parthenope'
(' T is said) doth chel-ish queer designs on thee!
