THE PRAYER OF JULIUS¹

(1873)

O GERTRUDE, virgin chastex o sacred to the Lord,
To weeping J ulius' prayer a kindly ear accord.

Thrice blessed though thou art in realms of heavenly rest,
Thy olden love, Ι know, stin warms thy faithful breast.

From out thino azure sky a. helping hand extend,
And hem-bs so dear to thee from threatening ills defend.

Sweet many, my babeS, our dem-est parente, guide—
And lead me on with them safe to thy loving side.
