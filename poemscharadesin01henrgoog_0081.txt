POEMS

TO THE SAME¹

(1873)

Wmff foaming creste the troubled sea ,
Leaps to its cloud-girl: canopy.

Wind-buffeted, with broken mast,
The tossing vessel siuks at last.

A palsied sear each heart enslavee,
Whilst Death waits in the ravening wavee.

My father weep33 my wife, with hair
Dishevelled‚ beate the darkening air ;

Ι clasp my young ones: “ Help! '' I cry,
“ HeIp, sister, from thy harboring sky:

“ Shine through the stol-m, O beacon-star3
0² er the vast deep stretch forth afar

“Thy hand to snatch us from the sea
And list our sinking hearts to thee,

“ In sweet embraceS, as of yore,
To prajse the Lord forevermore! '’

²)Ju11un employa the allegory of ο, amp in his prayer to his nister aex-trude.
