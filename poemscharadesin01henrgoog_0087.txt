POEMS

Perugia, new-espoused¹ to thee of God,
Thou seest again, and Umbria's grateful sod.

By sacred right, full thirty years and more
The Shepherd feeds his floek from ample storo.

Then Rome ae Cardinal ² saluteth thee,
And Belgio knighthood ⁸ orowns thy ministry.

Ah me! so loyal is thy people‘s love,
Thou scaroe canet hope a guerdon from abovel

But why recall the fleeting shows of earth ’ἒ
One only wisdom hath perennial worth:

“ Passeth the figure of this world away '’—
Follow the path that leads to endlese Day,

Until eterna] peace be thy reward
Safe in the starljt mansione of the Lord!

O may that pitying Lord the orown prepare,
And the sweet Virgin list thy lowly prayer!
