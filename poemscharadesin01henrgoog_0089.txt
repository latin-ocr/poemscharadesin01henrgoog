POEMS

TO GEREMIA BRUNELLI

(Professor of Rhetoric)
(1876)ι

ἮΗΙΙΕΤ Ι at Sena, 'neath a blazing sky
With Adria's wind and wave the Crab defy,

A greeting and a pledge of love you send—
Prayers that your J oachim to heaven commend.

For such a gift, to such a poet sweet,
What kind of thamus, Brunelli, should be meet?

I'll answer song with song and prayer with prayer:
“May God forever keep you in His care! ’'
