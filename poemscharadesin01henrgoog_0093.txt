ST. HERCULANUS

(1874)

HERCULANUS, a man of remarkable sanctity, was
Bishop of Pei-ugia at the time when the Goths were
besieging the city. Upon its capture, he was beheaded3
and his body, cast outside oi the walls, was decently
buried by some kindly hands. Forty days afterwards,
the citizens returned to Perugia‚ and, desiring to give
the body a holier resting-place in the church of S.
Peter, Prince of the Apostles, had it disinterred. It
was found to be whole and incorrupt in every part, the
head and neck being joined so thoroughly that no traco
of the incision could be found. The people of Perugia
venerate him as their¹ heavenly Patron, while the piety
of their ancestors built and dedicated a church in his
honor.
