SAIN T HERCULANUS
(1874)

Ο MIGHTY Guarffian of this land,
Hail, Herculanus, holy Priestl

Stretch forth to ue a helping hand,
who sing thy yearly Feast.

Forth of the bleak Gethaean shore
The furious 'rotila had burst,
And fair Perugia's walls no more
Withstood his horde aoeurst.

For 101 its bulwarked citadel
Is sore beset and blood-besprent‚
And all the streete the chorus swell

of grief and loud lament.

But Thou, unmoved amid the shock
And din of war, a Shepherd still,
Dear watch and ward keep'st o’er thy flock

To save from threatened ill.
