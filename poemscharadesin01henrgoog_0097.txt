POEMS

Thy words are shafts of fire: “ The swerd
Must save the Faithl your foes withstandl
Strike for the altars of the Lord‚
Strike for the fatherland1'’

Thy voice enduee each nerveless arm
With strength and power as from on high:
· They sear no more the loud alarm,
But fight to win—or die.

Long seven years (the story runs) ¹—
Thy leadership the city saved3

The thronging hosts of Dacia’e sons
In vain their banners waved.

Alaek, the fatal day when Thou,

Foremost in saith and love arrayed,
Laid’st in the dust thy priestly brow‚
Not conquered, but betrayed.

'T is guile, not prowe58‚ conquerethl
The foe is swarming o' er the walls:

For thy dear flock Thou greetest death
As one who gladly falls.

¹)A000rd1ng to recent historiam. the siege lasted but seven months—a
view which it ia not our purpose either to affirm or to deny. ·
