Pomm

When Totila the merciless

Decrees for Theo the severing swerd,
Thou diest—but thy people bleso

A Martyr of the Lordl

And now, in mansione of the bloet,
Thou reignest ’mid the heavenly band,
As “ Shepherd‚ Father '’ still addressed,
To save thy fatherlandl

Ο thou Etruscan city fair,
Rejoice‚ such glory thou hast found ;
Lift up thy head beyond compare,
With hundred turrets crowned!

Thongh now by falser foes benet,
Fight still the battle of the free—

The Faith thy Patron kept, be yet
More beautiful in theol
