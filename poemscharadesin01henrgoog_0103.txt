GEASE, babbling tongues! Whom earth de-
Begonel for 't ie the holy eve ¹ [lightn‚
Of the great Feaet that shall receive

A Martyr’e solemn ritee.

Ο mighty Patron saint, who art

The guardian glory of this land,

Auspicious view the honore planned
By Umbria's faithful beart.

It leape with joy to list thy name,

Heroie Martyr, to the skieS,

Forgetful of thetarnished prize
That crowne a Caesar'e fame.

Now snowy whitenees heaped upon
Each mountain-peak, the Winter' views;
Aquarius with frozen dewe

Drenehee the bright-haired eun.
