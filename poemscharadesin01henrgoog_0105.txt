POEMS

Nor Winter, raging o’er the earth,
Nor heaven' s cloudy coronal,
Delays the yearly festival

Or chills the holy mirth.

The twilight deepens into night3

Yet fills each street a thronging host:

And through the gloom the hills are crossed
With myriad-gleaming light.¹

Behold, in prayerful guise arrayed,

March to the walls with reverent joy,

The gray-haired sago, the guileless boy,
The metron and the maid.

There on the holy Martyr's tomb

The gleaming lights a splendor shed3

While thousand chanting voices spread
A glory through the gloom:

“Thy children, Father‚ deig-n to hear:
Thy fiock, Ο Shepheffi, deign to bless V'

Anon a thousand lips caress
The ancient sepulchre.

¹)Bvery year on the Eve of the renat orst. constantius, the Perusinus.
following tn ancient cnutoni, march in solemn processior: outslde the walls,
bearing osten-inas. This is known ns the “Feast oi munst us the whole
city is ablue with tomhes and npetu, and the suburbe with ,orou- boum
