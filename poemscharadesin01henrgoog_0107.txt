'I‘HE temple-gates at length uncloe03

With myriad lights the altar glows:

O joyful greet your Martyr's name
With loud acclaiml

Against the pagan ritas he strove,

And mocked the thunderbolts of Jove:

Fearless he viewed the tormenta dire
Of sword and fire.

The caldron feels the leaping flames:
Amidst the breathless crowd proclaims

The praetor: “ Lol the waters orave
The gebel slave! ’'

A marvel! 'Neath the Martyr's feet
The seething caldron seems aa sweet
As a cool fount that sparkling leads

Through flowery moade.

Abaehed, the crowds in wonder gaze;
And eries the praetor in amaze:
“ Bind him, and let the noisome cell
Hie magio que111’'
