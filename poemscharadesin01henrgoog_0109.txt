POEMS

But chains nor dungeon can control

The saving atterance of the soul:
His guarda the Word of Truth receive,
fleat, and believe!

Now storms of rage the tyrant urge:

Τ116 3111111666 flesh is torn with 66611136

Α1κ1 sword3 while iron shackles greet
The guileless feet.

Nor these the praetor's wrath appense, .

who to 1116 slighted deities
The Saint as viatim offereth
In bloody death.

The col-pse 16 cast into the mire:

At daybreak Levian draweth 11131161

From out the friendly shadowing veil
That marks the gaol.

He 6611166 to seek, with reverent tread,
Τ116 scattered limbus, the severed head:
At length the sacred urn contains

Τ116 blest 1611161116.

Four sightless can-iere are found
To bear it to Perugia’s bound;
They touch the urn: O prodigy

of grace—they see!
