POEMS

So eomes the Shepherd back, in calm

01 laurel-wreath and martyr-palm:

Orownod with the glory of the skies
The Hero lies!

Revisit us, Ο Patron grand-

This fioek of thino, this Umbrian land;

And bring with Theo a rich increase
of heavenly peace!

A mitred pastor, once of old

1 ehared thy labore, watched thy sold:

Me didst thou kindly guido aright
With thy dear light:

Now Peter’s bark through troubled scas
1 guido, and 'gainst the storm-fraught breem
With hope assured 1 list mine eyes

Up to Thy skies:

Ο when the storms of lise are o’er,

May Lno gain the peaceful shore,

And to his shallop frail be given
The port of Heaven!
