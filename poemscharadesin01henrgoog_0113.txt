chun, appointed by pope St. vietor to bo
bishop of Folign0‚ of which he was a native, zealously
oerried the light of the Gospel to the inhabitante of
Umbria and Picenum. L. Flavius, Prefect of Assisi,
ordered him to be beatem and the Emperor Decius,
victorious over the Pereians and Medea, whilst trav-
eling through Umbria, ordered him, although in
extreme old age, to be cast into prison and to suffer
various kinds of torture; until, a glorious martyr, he
amended to his heavenly fatherland. The Foligneee

the greatest devotion.
