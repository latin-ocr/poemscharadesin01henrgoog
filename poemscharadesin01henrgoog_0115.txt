POEMS

TO SAINT FELIOIAN, BISHOP AND
MARTYR

(1892)

Emeum let a martyr’s fame

Exalt forevermore thy name ;

Thy sepulchre and altar sti-ew
With gerlande ever new Ι

Foligno’s mighty Ptelate! see

Thy thronging cliente honor thee,

Father and Patron, as of yore
With love’s unceasing etore Ι

This was thy See; and here thy sold

A welcome gave, bnt could not hold

A Shepherd long, whose charity
Sought wider ministry.

No labore could thy spirit break,
Nor War's alarm ὼγ fears awake;
Thus Umbria and Picenum see
The Cross's victory Ι
