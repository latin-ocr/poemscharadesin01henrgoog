POEMS

Through thee, the Truth in glory chinea

On broken altars, falh’ng shrines:

Thus Faith the crown of triumph wore,
A bloodless conqueror.

Hell launches myriad angry darts
And proves a hundred subtle arte
The fruita of victory to steal

And quench thy til-eleas zeal.

Let Flavius work his tyrant will—

'I'hou only standeet firmet still:

Nor taunts, nor threaoe, nor chaine oan' bind
Thy free and fearless mind.

Yon, rather, to his lumel-maath
The Hero hantone, while his brath,
Foeble with age and battling long,

The loving Lord makes strong.
