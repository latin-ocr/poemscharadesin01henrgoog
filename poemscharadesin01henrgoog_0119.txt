POEMS

Victorinus o' er the Persian host,
Yet hating Christ’s dear Name the most,
Growned with imperial dignity,

Decius would conquer 'ram 1

And yet, what power in Caesar’s will,
Or in his hangman's threatening ekill ⁰?
Unto his servant Gon shall yield

A still more potent ehield.

Onam-'s viatim falleet thou-behold,
The gates of Paradiee uniold 1

Midst heavenly armies thou art found
With festa] garlanda erowned 1

Shine forth from out thy heaven afar,
O’er Umbria's fielde‚ Ο friendly Star;
The blind earth gropes thro’ devious ways—

Send forth thy golden rays 1
