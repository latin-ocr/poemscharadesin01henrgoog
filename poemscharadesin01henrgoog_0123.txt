THE HOLY FAMILY

(1892)

VESPBR mmm

eIESUs, the Light of realme above,
Sole Hope to mortale given,

Whose Childhood crowned domestic love
With gloriee‘caught from heaven ε

Ave Maria, full of grace,
Above archangele blest

To hold thy Son in eweet embrace
And foed Him from thy breaet:

J oeeph, of patriarche alone
The Virgin'e chosen guido,

Whoee heart the joy supreme hath known
When J esus “ Father'' cried :—

Springing from J esee’e noble root
To share a Work divine,
Prosper your cliente' lowly suit ⁸
Uttered before your shrine.
