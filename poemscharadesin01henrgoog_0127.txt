POEMS

A THOUSAND lights their glory shed

On shrines and altars garlanded3

While swinging censere dusk the air
With perfumed prayer.

And shall we sing the ancestry
of J eene, Son of God most High ¹?

Or the heroie names retraee
of David’s race ¹?

Sweeter is lowly Nazareth,
Where J esus drew His ehildish breath—
Sweeter the singing that endears

His hidden years 1

An Ange] leads the pilgrim band
From Egypt to their native land,

. Where J esus clinga to Joseph’s arm,
Securo from herm. ”

“ And the Child grew in wisdom's ken

And years and grace with God and men3 ''

And in His father’s humble art
Took share and part.
