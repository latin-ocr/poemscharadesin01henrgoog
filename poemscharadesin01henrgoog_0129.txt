“With toil‚” saith He, “my limbo are wet,
Prefiguring the Bloody Sweat: '²
Ah1 how He beers our chastisement

With sweet content 1

At J oseph’s bench, at J esus’ side,

The Mother site, the virgin-brid03

Happy, if she may 011661· their hearte
With leving arte.

Ο Β16886ἀ Three Ι who felt the sting
Of want and toil and suffering,

Pity the needy and obscure
Lot of the poor:

Banish the “ pride of life ’² from all
Whom ampler wealth and joye befall:
Be every heart with love repaid

That seeks your aid!
