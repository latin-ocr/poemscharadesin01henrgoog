POEMS

num AT LAUDs

Ο nonen οε Nazareth the mest,
Fair hostess of the Lord,

The Church was nurtured at thy breast
And shared thy scanty hoard.

In all the spreading lande of earth
The wandering sun may see

No dearer spot, no ampler worth
Than erst was found in thee!

We know thy humble tenement
Wae heaven's hermitage:

Celestial heralde came and went
In endlees embassage.

There, whatsoever J oseph aske
Christ hastens to fulfill;

While Mal-y loves the household taeks
That wait her joyous will.

There, J oseph toileth at her side
Her joys and griefs to share,
With thousand ties knit to his bride,

Of love and work and prayer.
