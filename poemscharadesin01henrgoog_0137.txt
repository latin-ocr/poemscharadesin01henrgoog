POEMS

TO THE SAME
(1885)

sleE flowery meads through which you pass
In fancy, are but Hell's morass—
A Serpent hideth in the grass Ι

This deadly field hath Satan sown:
Do thou his crafty arte disown,
And hate the pleasures thou hast known.

Courage and earnest work be thin03
The Lord looks on with eye benign,
And nervos thy will with strength divine.

Already, see, by Grace o'erborne,
The baffled Sel-pent flies the mom,
And hides in Stygian caves forlom Ι
