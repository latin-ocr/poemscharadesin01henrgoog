POEMS

AN AUGURY OF TRIUMPH

M INE eye prophetie ecana the darkling heaven
with dawn's bright arrows riven:

Forthwith the horrid crew of hellish error
Fliee to the Stygian pool in terrori

God'e enemiee, compelled to view the vision,
Confess with tears their long misprision.

The centuried hatee, the olden strifee are ended:
Vietorious Love hath all amended!

Now exiled Virtue eeeks again her dvmlling,
of stainlees saith and candor telling3

Peaee, olive-meathed, bids art and soienee flourish,
And Plenty's horn is here to nourishz

In vain shall Hell its myriad errore muster—
Here Wisdom shines with olden lustre.

Ο bleesed Italyl Ο wondrous gloryl

Ο Faith enshrined in art and story!
