ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST

Tm: PREOURSOR

(1886)
I

IN the J udean solitudo,
clad in the skins of beante he stood—
Locuste and honey wild‚ his food.

He crieth in the wilderness:
Ο ye whom clouds of error prese,
Hear me, and all your sins confess!

The awful Day of God is nigh3
From His tremendous iudgments fly;
With sorrowing team beseech the sky:

Wash out your sins with sigh and grean,
And for your wicked past atone-

The way to Heaven is this alone!
