THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST¹

(1887)

Fomn of the hiny eamean land,
Unto the J ordan’e mystio strand,

The Baptiet came, led by the hand of God,
To waeh the natione in ite flood.

Hither the pressing multitudee have hied
To be baptized and sanctified.

And here they see Him prese the sacred sod—
J mue, the mighty Son of Gon,

Hiding‚ with downoast eye and modest grace,
The lightning splendore of His Face.

The lustral Sign for guilty sinnere meant
Hm humbly cravee—the Innocent.

¹) 'rhen went out tohlm Jerusalem md all sudet. md all the country
about sordem md were baptimo by him ln the Jordan . . . ‘rhen eometh
Jesus stom thssee to the Jordnn, unto John, to be baptized by him. But
John stayed him, stylus: 1 ought ιο be baptimo by thee, md comest thou

and lo! the hemena were opened to him z and he saw the spirit of God de-

wending aa a dove, and coming upon him. And behold ο, voioe stom heaven
owing: 'rhi- ιο my beloved Son. in whom 1 tm well ple-sed. (Mn-r. ιιι).
