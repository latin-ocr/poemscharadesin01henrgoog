POEMS

But John perceives the Gonnum I should'be
Baptioed by Thoe, ‘not Thou by me!

Yet he obeys, yielding to God’s dessign,
And bathes the awful Brow divine.

And lo! the heavens are rent, and glory bright
Floods the baptismal sward with light:

And from the shining vault descende a Dove‚
And rests the sacred Head above.

'T was Gon, ’t was very Gon descended then,
Deve-like unto the eyes of men:

And as It softly tested on His head,
Came from the slfy a Voice that said:

Jamweapmmamy bazowam.-
· Him shall με hear !—O Holy One,

J nsua, thou Son of Gon, the world hath heard
And bowed submissive to that Word;

And to thy N ame doth holiest homage pay,
who art the Truth, the Life, the Way.
