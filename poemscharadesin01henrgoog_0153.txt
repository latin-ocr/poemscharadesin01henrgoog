ΟΝ ΤΗΕ WORDS OF PSALM XIII.:

Destmwtion a'nd unhappiness are i‘n their ways, and the way
of peace they have not known.

(1887)

WHOSO pursues an evil 001'1rse,

Hath made a comrade of Remorse:

His soul at once is made aware

Of anxious fear and gnawing care3

For Sin is Sorrow! and the Lord
Holds o’er his head the avenging sword 1
