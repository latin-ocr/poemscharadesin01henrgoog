POEMS

ΟΝ ECOL. XXXIV. 16:

He that searah the Lord shall tremble at nothing), and shall
not be afraid .· for he 2⁰3 laiss hope.

BUT to the just is peace: no strife
Disturbs the gentle stream of life.

Fearless he looks on Deam, nor broods
Anxious o' er life's vicissitudes.

Though buffeted by storm and strese
Of Fortune's wauton changefulness,

Fato can not touch the soul sublime
Taught to despise the things of Time.

Whom should he sear? he can not yield,
With God Himself for sword and shield 1
