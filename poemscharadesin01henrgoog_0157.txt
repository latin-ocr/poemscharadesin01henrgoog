IT was a favorite project of the Pope, when he was
Bishop of Perugia‚ to relieve at his own expense the
scarcity of water from which the citizens of Carpineto
suffered, and he accordingly had an abundant supply
led down from the nearest mountain. On account of
the nature of the soil, however, the springs began to
fail and the supply gradually lessened until it seemed
to have entirely ceased. He therefore sought another
source, and the work was successfully completed on
J anuary 1st, 1888—the day on which he celebrated the
Golden J ubilee of his first Mass.
