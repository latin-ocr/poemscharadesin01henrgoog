POEMS

II

In Upper Per-aym, near the Ancient Mamion os the Peccie.

AETER a Journey long and ἀπεαπ,
Ye Cal-pinetam, I am here,
A fount unfailing, eool and clear.

For Lm, who on Peter's throne
As Shepherd of his floek is known

And loved in every Christian zone—

What time to fair Italia’s shore
The trembling wings of Rumor bore¹
Rumblings of European war—

Praying with deep solicitude
For peace, before the altar stood
The Priest whom lustres ten had viewed:

His beart had never yet outworn
Love for the spot where he was born,
And balmy airs of life's young mom:

ι) ‘towards the olo-e or the year 1888. Europe was disturbet! by retra of a
war.
