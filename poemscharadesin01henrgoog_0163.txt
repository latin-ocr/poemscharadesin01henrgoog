POEMS

’Twas then, ye Carpinetan folk,
He bade me come to you: and broke
Gently my immemorial yoke,

And taught my dancing feet to epum
The heedless hill-top, and zoiourn
For your sake, in this chiseled urn:

Clearer than crystal to the view,
From the high rocks 1 scatter deW,
And sing the livelong day for you!

Ye suffered long in fruitless quest
Until I came—a weloome guest—
With amploet largess in my breast.

And who shall all my uses tell ⁸?

γ Here in your very midst Ι dwell,

For poor and rich, for eick and well.

Come,‚then‚ ye cite, and freely take,
While 1 perpetual musio make
of thanks to Lno for your sake!
