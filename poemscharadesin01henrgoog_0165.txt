A SiGH

013· THE 'mus'rm som,

Fumone rages the fray:
Lucifer, watching intent
For the uncertain event,

Marshals hie hellish array.

Help me, Ο Mother, this day3
List to thy elient’s lament:
Lo! 1 am weak and o’erspent‚

Moulded of spirit and clay.

Under thy virginal heel
Crushing the serpent of old,

Ah! to thy servant reveal
Power the prophete foretold:

Then shall my spirit, tho' weak‚
Only of victory speakl
