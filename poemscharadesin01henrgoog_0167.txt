SUPPLICATION OF THE LOVING SOUL

Hm, ΜοΊῊΕΒι the enehanted ear
“ Hail, dearest Memor! ’' loves to hear.
My love, my hope, my heart’s delight‚
In storm-rent seas my beacon-light:
When sinful pleasuree woo my beart,
And thousand fears within me staria,
Thy child with poignant cares opprest
Take, Virgin Motha, to thy breast.
When hastes my dying hour, repel
The demon to his deepest hell:

Be thou with me in heavenly guise,
Cloee gently my age-wearied eym,

And lead my soul to Pax-adise.
