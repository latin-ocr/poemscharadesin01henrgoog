OUR LADY'S ROSARY
A PRAYER Fon HELP
Interpretations¹
(1895)

Ι

WITH one accord, Ο Mother fair,
Thy children offer as a prayer
The seented bloom of roses rare.

The prayer is heard and answered3 we
Reeeive from ὼγ dear hand the free
Mercies ὼγ Lord commite to thee!

II
We kneel before thy shrines to prove
A Mother’s care: from Heaven above
Aooept the pledges of our love.

No geme we bring to thee, nor gold ;
Our little baskete only hold
The wreathed flowers of field and wold:

The lowly violet's penury,
The snowy lily's chastity,
The purple roee’s agonyl

III
And while our leving hands would frame
A worthy ehaplet, we proolaim
Again and yet again ὼγ Name.

ι) Os the word Rotam—that ⁸⁸ most aeoepmble prayer for the protoeflon or

the mother os God.” 15⁷
