POEMS

Be thou our favoring Patron here3
Be thou our Guide in deserte drear3
Be thou our Help when death is near!

IV

How well thy client Gusman wrought
Thy will in every deod and thought-
The weaving of thy Rosary taught!

On earth, a grateful taek and sweetl
But oh, more grateful, should our feet
But gain at last the heavenly seat!

Then sweeter far ’t will be to raise
To thee a wreathod song of praise,
Ο Virgin bloet, through endless days,

V

Take to your hearts the roses rare
Your Mother giveth to your care,
And joyous weave the chaplet fair.

Lo! we obey the high command:
What then shall be the guerdon grand ‘?

O trust the issue to her hand!

Υθε, tmst in her who shall uniold
In Heaven her great reward—behold,
For wreathing roseo, orowns of gold!
