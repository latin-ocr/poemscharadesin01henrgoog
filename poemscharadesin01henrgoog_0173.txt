POEMS

TO THE “HELPER OF CHRISTIANS”

(1895)

BUT now the lyre, Ο mighty Virgin‚ sings
Thy victoria, with deeper-sonnding stringe.

How oft. ὼγ power proclaimed a glad euroeaee
01 War, with white-winged messengers of Peace!

Be thou the witneSS‚ Franeel—When hellish snares
Beeet thy path of glory unawares3

When thou, for saith and virtue qnee renowned,
Didst cast thy ancient splendore to the ground3

When viee and error ruled ὼγ fairest sod,
And slew with filthy breath ὼθ sons of God:

Ah! then the Virgin brake ὼγ hideous chain,
Calling her champion from chivalrie Spain,

With but. the Rosary for sword and shield:
“ To this alone‚'' she cried, “ the foe must yield 1²³

Such was his weapon—Gusman thus begins

Heroic battle, and the trophy wins;
