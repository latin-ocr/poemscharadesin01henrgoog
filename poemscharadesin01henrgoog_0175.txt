POEMS

Thus, David-like, his tens of thousands slew,
That France might once again her saith renew.

A witness, next, from the Ionian seas—
The far-iamed battle of the Echinades.

The warring vessels, ranged in battle line,
Fling to the breeze3‚ each a various sign:

Here is the banner of the Virgin fair,
And here the Crescent flaunts the fearful air:

The trump resounds—the breathless hush is riven,
And ceaseless elamor rends the vault of heaven3

Flash the red lightnings, and the thunders roar
In thousand echoings from the affrighted shore.

With shattered oars and timbers gaping wide,
Sinks many a vessel in the expectant tide;

While mangled corpses find a watery grave,
And streaming life-blood reddens every wave.

Doubtful the issue stands: with equal art
Foe strives with foe—uncertain still they part:

And yet again the crash and roar—when lo!
(who shall divine the cause ?) the Turkish foe

Whose migbtier power but spoke of victory,

Struck with a sudden terror, turn and fiee,
