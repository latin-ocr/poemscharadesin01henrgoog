POEMS

And to the Christiane (wondrous to relatel)
Inglorious yield the etrenuous combat'e fate.

“All hail 1²² the victore cry, “to Mary'e Name!’'
And echoing shores prolong the grand acclaim.

While in the triumph Christian Europe sees
One of the mighty Virgin’s Prodigiee‚

More bleet the Roman eyes that could behold
A miracle, ae Pius had foretold.

Thenceforward peace to troubled Europe came,
And Christian worship gained a noble fame.

Let coming ages (why do they delay?)
With just memorial celebrate the day;

In snowy marble raise a temple grand
To signalize the memorable strand‚¹

And the rose-crowned Virgin Queen ens‘hrine
To rule the eeas that saw her wondroue Sign 1

¹) Christian piety commemorate-5 the triumph by the erection, at Patras,
of a church dedicated to Our Lady of the {tonat-y.
