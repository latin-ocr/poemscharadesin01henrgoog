POEMS

J OSEPH

eIUSTICE is satisfied3 the debt is paid;¹
The starry sky is mine at last—but thou
Dost hold a mighty office, and to God
Owest the more, the more He gives to thee.
Couragel thy bark still pilot o' er the deep:
Sweet is the toil and worthy great reward,
Which thou dost undergo sor holy Faith!
Yet, that thou may'st the heighte of heaven scale,
Nor touch the burning peel, remember well,
Ο J oachim, amidst thy mortal life,

To waeh away thy sins with tears and sighsl

J OACHIM

YEA, while the spirit rulee these weary limbs‚
shall Ι, with eighs heaved from my inmost heart,
And bitter tears, strive to undo m'y guilt:

But thou, secure and bleet with heavenly light,
Look on me, bowed with yearS, broken with cares;
And from thy sky behold thy brother here,

So long oppressed with tempeet, ahl eo long
Wearied with storm and strees and battling wavesl
