POEMS

“FOR LOVE IS STRONG AS DEATH1”¹

DEATH claimed him, and he met the common doom:
In dreams I see you stand beside his tomb‚

And tearless press the swelling sorrow down-—

Say rather, glimpse the fadeless lamel·orown;

For with fair brow raised to the bending sities,
Hopeful you look toward heaven with love-lit eyes!
Ah! whence thy strength and constanoy of mind?
Faith nourished it3 and Hope auspicious shrined
God’s promises within thy heartl and so

Thou wouldst not yield thy soul to depths of woe.
Anon you see a sudden splendor bright

Suffuse the golden gates of heaven with light!

Open they swing; and lo! before your eyes

His dear face smiles on you from Paradise.

Ah me, with what a joy your heart must swelll

Iu flamed with love it bids the last “ Farewe]l‚”
And shall with endless praise besiege God’s citadell
