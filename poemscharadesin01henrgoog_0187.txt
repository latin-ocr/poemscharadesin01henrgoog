POEMS

“REMEMBER THY OREATOR IN THE
DAYS OF THY YOUTH '¹

ENTER at once the “ narrow path ”5
No Opem, Sessame! it hath:

Long heats and burdens must you bear-

Wet are the browe that laurels wear! ¹

ι) 'rho Pope ordered these lines to be plaoed under his pot-uuit in 011,
which he presented. in the year 1888, to the Roman society of catholic
Youth. named after the Apostle St. Peter.
