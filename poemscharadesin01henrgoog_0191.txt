SING, YE AROADIANS Ι

ΝΕΑΝΒΕΒ, from his cimel,
Whom erst the jealous Muses did compel
In groves of Arcady to dwell‚

Sends greeting unto every one,
And bids you scale the heighte of Helicon,
And play Maeonian stringe upon.

A parting wish his lips would frume:
Perpetual glory to the Arcadian name,
And ampleet wealth of olden fame!
