NEANDER HERACLEUS

SINGS ‘11:113 PRAISES 01³· ARCADIA

HE who, in Grecian style, the name Neander bore,
Full many a boyish ditty spun of yore3

At Aganippe’s brook his flock he shepherded‚
And by Permessus’ wandering waters fed.

Older‚ he bide you mount Pindus, and joyful see
Lifted to heaven the same of Arcady.

Girole with leafy green your flowing looks ; prolong
On oaten stop the burden of your song!

Awaited long, while years have silent slipped away,
Propitious comes at length the natal day

Of Arcady the blest, deal· to the Sacred Nine,
Worthy the mindful poets’ frenzy fine.

Ι sing how Arcady first drew each dreaming heart;

How 'twas ennobled by Argolic art;
