POEMS

And how the wandering bande of shepherds—men of
worth,
Illustrious names throughout the toeming earth—

How to Arcadia their spirits willing epod,
Ι know not by what subtle qweetness led!

Some did the laurels phase, and some the grassy plote,
And some the darkling ease of Bacchic grots:

Some from a rustic reed, beneath the shady oak
Rechning, shepherd-music would evoke5

Or on the twanging lyre in Lesbian numbers dream
To the soft lullaby of lapsing stream.

First. MetastasiQ with festal garlands orownod,
Ι love to name, and his just praise to sound:

From never—failing breasts fed by the Graces Three3
Taught of the Muso untoilsome melody3

Soothing the fretted ear with his mellifluous tone,—
Him Austria's court imperial made its own.

Some felt the sharper fiame; and, soaring lightning-
browed‚ ’
Thundered majestio from the enveloping cloud:

Them did Calliope compel to arduous ⁴ways—

Strong singer of the old heroic days,
