*POEMS

Parini, too, who seourged the folliee of the time,
Or scaled like Pindar the far height sublime:

Careless the fatherland Insubrian saw his need
Whom to the stare avenging Time shall lead!

N or him, Italia's son, my faithful song forget,
of all her tragic bards the coronet:

For, singing mighty themeS, Alfieri could be seen
Treading with buskined foot Arcadia’e green:

His tragic musings wrought with fineet Grecian art,
Renewed the Sophoclean mind and beart.

Ο splendid band of bardsl to whom Apollo gave
A sacred name, and songe that bridge the grave!

Skilled in Maeonian song, on you with kindly mien
The Muses looked, and gracioue brow serene.

Your brows are wreathed with bays; forever ye belong
To Fame, enrolled amid the heavenly throng.

O meed of toileome Art! Ο undeceitful Fame!

Ο glory born of the Arcadian name!
