POEMS

Let not the foolish mob disputa their honors high,
Nor green-syed Envy raiss a jealous cry:

Let them the pinnacle of templing heaven ses
Blaze with the glowing Stat of Aroedy!

O may it evermore in grander orbits move-
Pindus illume, and every hill and grove!

Here shall the Muses rest; here with perennial dew
Castalian founts the fainting earth renew,

Here the Arcadians drink—Arcadians sleiued in sony!
Hither did Maro bid the adventurous throng

who would with swelling port majestis themes rehearse‚
Or tilth and meadow sing in mellower verse.

Ο Poesy divine! may thy delights increase,
clad in the fairest draperiss of Greece!

May the barbaric art of numbers, to the shore
Ausonian brought, be banished evermorel

To the Arcadiam, N eander (now grown old)
These last and dem-est wishes doth unfold!
