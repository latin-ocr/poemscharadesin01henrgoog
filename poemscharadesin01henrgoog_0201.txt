TO GUGLIELMO GARD. ΜΑΞΒΑΙΑι

WITH staff of heavenly truth you struck their hearte
of rook 3
Then, a good Shepherd, led them to Christ’s flook.

“My life, my workS, be hid!'' ² your modest spirit
pleads:
Ah, but the world should know such zealous deedS,

Such combats waged with hell, such wondrous works of
God,

And the Cross planted deep in Ethiop sod.

The unforgetful page awaits thy bashful pen:
Come, let thy fame be sweet to lips of men,

That other hands may reap a glorious aftermath,
And follow bravely where you blazed a path.
