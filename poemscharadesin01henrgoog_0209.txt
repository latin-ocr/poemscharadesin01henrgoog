“PRAISED BE CHRIST, WHO LOVES
THE FRANKS 1 '² ¹

(1896)

'PHERE is a God who rulee the earth, and rende
The lofty mountain, sparee the lowly hill:
“ There's a Divinity that shapes our ende,

Rough hew them how we will !''

olevia, they say, at length on God relieS,

Viewing the Teuton hosts with anxious brow3

Then lifteth up to heaven his kingly eyes,
Breathing a solemn vow:

“ Help me, Ο God, to whom my dearest sponse
So oft hath offered prayer and praise divin03
11 Thou our faltering eourage wilt arouse,

I am forever Thine 1² ’

And lo! a sudden eourage seizee all
The Frankish host3 sear and dismay have fied:
With ardor new upon the foe they fall,

And strew the earth with dead.

ι) written ror the rourteenth oentenary ot the baptism of movit, to eom
‘memento the auspicamus event when the whole nation of the Franks. ronow·
ing hia example. gave mels to christ.
