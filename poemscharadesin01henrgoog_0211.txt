POEMS

clovis, thy prayer is heard. Thy favored head
Benoath the yoke of Christ thou needs must bow:

At Rheime awaits thy coming, heaven-led,
The priest with mitrod brow.

Dream I? for Iol each hanuet, spear and helm

cast at the altar'e foot where lowly kneel

(novis, his cohorte, and the Frankish roalm,
Baptismal fioods ιο feel 1

Thrice-happy Rome, thino the inheritanoe

Of the redeeming grace of Christ the King:

How willingly ιο thy dear hands doth Franco
Her conquering laurels bring 1

Dour mother Rome, how gladly Franco declares

Herself thy “ first-born ”-(ι1ι16 that ende-ars 1)—

Plaeing a truetful hand in thino she fares
All-prosperous through the years 1

How I rejoice to soe the lengthening 11116

Of Gallie Heroeel Him that gave ιο ssight

The furious Aistulf—how his glories shine,
Lover of sacred right,

Zealous avenger of the Roman state3
Twioo through the riven Alpe a fearlose way
Throading‚ ιο place the resouod cities’ fat-e
