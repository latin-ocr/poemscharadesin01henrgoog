POEMS

Twioe seven centur-ies bath saith imbued

Your nervos with strength secure from Satan’s arts:

To the Vesle ¹ hasten, and let saith renewed
Inflame your zealons hearts.

Unto remotest bounds of earth may Franco
Be known and honored: in the Eastern land
May she forever prosper, and advanee

What hopes her beart hath plannedl

The saith of Christ-— be that her highest gain:
Once lost, what can its happy days recall ⁶?

For 't was of old, and ever must remam,
The glory of the Gaul.

¹) Rhama, dtunted on the vesle (ο, tributary o! the Alme), became tho
ercule of chnstimty for the Franks.
