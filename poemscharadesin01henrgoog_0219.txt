DEATH

(1897)

ΤΗΒ weetering sun drawn near his cloudy bed,
Lm, and gradual darkness veile thy head:

The sluggish life-blood in thy withered veina
More slowly runs its course—what then remains ?

Lol Death is brandishing his fatal dart,
And the grave yearns to shroud thy mortal part:

But from ite prison freed, the soul expande
Exulting pinions to the enfranchised lande.

My weary race is run—I touch the goaI:
fleat, Lord, the feeble pantings of my Βοιὼ

If it be worthy, Lord, thy pitying breast
Weloome it unto everlasting rest!

May I behold thee, Queen of earth and sky,
Whose love enchained the demone lut-king nigh

The path to heaven ; and freely shall I own
’T was thy sweet care that gained my bliesful crown!
