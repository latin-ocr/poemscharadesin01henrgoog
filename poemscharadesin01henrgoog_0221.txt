J ULIUS STERBINI

(1897) -

«Imus, as gift ω thee, 1 send
The Saviour’s amm? whence fiow
Life-giving streame that have no end,
To heal our every woe.

O haste thee to that fountain clear3
Aeeept that healing bath:

In whiter raiment thou’lt appear
Than e' en the snowfiake bath!

Thou comest forth ; lo! eleensed of sin,
Now canet thou fix thine eye8‚

With eteadier gaze than eret had been,
Upon the expectant skiee.

O greatly derel securely leam
How fearleeely thy feet

Should earth's deeaying splendor spurn
To gain the heavenly seat.

ι) On the luth of September. 180⁶, Leo 1111 affeedonately eomeerated
Julius Sterblni and hia family to the august Hem-t of Jesuu in testimony
whereos he presented them with a picture or the Divino Hes-rt, and accom-
paule-d it wlth thie and the following poem.
