POEMS

Shame lurks in every earthly lust3
Fear then each foul desire:

Tread wauton pleasure in the duat
And quench the smouldering fire.

Christ's HEART alone thy wisdom be,
Thy strength, thy glory blest,

Thy Leve, that ceaseless as the sea
Beate in thy flaming breast:

A tower of strength that shall thy foes
And all their darts withstand3

‘A light that ease the pathway shows
Unto the Fatherland ἔ
