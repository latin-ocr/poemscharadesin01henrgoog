SACRED HEART

(1897)

GOD bide us love His ever-loving Son:
Hasten, Ο children, to the Saviour’s eide3
There only may your hearts and minds abide3

Through all the years to come, be this your one

Perpetual work, in tendereet youth begun—

’Το nourish love for J esus Crucified 1
Father and mother shall your footetepe guide,

And teach how sweetly God’s sweet will is done.

Ah, what more blessed refuge in the strife
May wearied spirits find, than J esus’ Hmnr?

That Fountain springing up to endless Life,
And seattering dewy baleam on each smart3

That Pledge of peace, where stormy war is rife‚
Making the very earth heaven’e counterpartl
