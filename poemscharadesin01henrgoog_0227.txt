POEMS

EPITHALAMIUM ¹

(189⁷)

'I'wo harto-tvvm altars-emm
A single love-lit flame:
You ask me whence it came ⁴?

Kindred in beart and soul—
Love silent on them stole
And gained complete control!

Sweeter ite victory,
When virtue's lawe deeree
Inviolate loyalty!

At Mary's shrine they bosv,
A mutual troth to vow
In love made holier now.

What more? I end my lay,
Heaven's ehoieeet gifts to pray
On this, their wedding day!

ι) On the nuptiale &Alpheum Sterbini and suun Pizzinni.
