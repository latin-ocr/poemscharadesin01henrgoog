POEMS

Of spice and piekle play the epicurei

Next, have the beakers foaming to the brim

With milk no thrifty maid hath dared to skim:

No draught than this more wholesome shall assuage
The thirst of childhood or deelining age.

Let golden honey be thy daintier fare ;

Of Hybla's nectar take a seantier share.

Be thy fresh eggs the talk of all the town—
Hard·boiled or soit, or fried to savory brown‚

Or poached‚ or dropped, or sipped raw from the shell,

Or done in ways too numerous to tell.
Add‘ herbs and salads to the feast—whatso

May in suburban gardens freely grow.
Bring forth the clustered fruitage of the vine,
Plucked where the clambering tendi-ils intertwine.

Have plums and pears—the bursting panniers erown
With red-oheeked apples laughing gaily down.
And, last, delicious fragrance of the East!
With oups of steaming Moeha close the feast3
But taste the amber with a lingering lip—
No hasty draughtl—'t was made for gods to sip!
Now if you diet thus, why, 1²11 engage,
You've found the secret of a green old age.

But Gluttony, Ofellus argues well,
Can quickly lay her snare, and cast her spell,
And lead to shipwreck like the siren shell.

This only is her dream: The festive board

Must groan with all that wealth and art afford.
