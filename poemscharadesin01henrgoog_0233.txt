POEMS

She spreads her costly napkins‚ meant for show,
'Twixt platee and glasses in a gleeming row:
Silver and gold the hooded lights illume,

While the air reeks with Araby’s persume.

Her table set, with hospitable air

She draws the thoughtless to her hidden snare3
On ivory couches bids their limbs recline,

And taps forthwith her cask of choicest wine
Sleeping old summere in the Falernian vine3
Cordials she offers next, and fine liqueurs

By patent arts distilled (for all are hersi) :

The guests drink eagerly with envious haste,
And gorge themselves with calte and juicy paste.
Then grosser dishes: a Lucanian boar

With oil, and spice, and pepper covered o’er;
Liver of duck, and leg of fatling hare,

Plover and squab, and all such gourmet-fare.
And what's not flesh is fish: turbots and clame,
Oysters, and what-not, caught in streams and dame.
A hugh murena fills the shining dish,

And swims amidst a shoal of smaller fish.

· The guests look on with hungry eyes: in fine,
With stomachs gorged, and veins afire with wine,
They rise to dance, where they have come to dine:
They rise to dance—each crazy bacchanal,
Bandying threats and blows‚ around the hall
Stumbles, till drunken stupors silence all.

But Gluttony looks on the rout, and smiles
