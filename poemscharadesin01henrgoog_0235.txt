POEMS

To see the outcome of her patient wiles:

How Circe's guests have sunk to shameful sleep,
As sailors perish in the yawning deep ;

And how anon the tortured liver wakes

To sudden protest5 how the stomach zachee,
While steaming sweat bedews the trembling umbe,
And a thick mist the bloodshot vision dims.
With the wrecked body brought to such a pase,
Shall Gluttony essay beyond? Alae!

Her arte would seek to bury in the sod

Even the soul—spark of the breath of G0d1
