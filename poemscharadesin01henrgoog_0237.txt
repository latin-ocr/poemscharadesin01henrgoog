THE OPENING CENTURY

(1900)

Α NOBLE nurse of all the arte,
The Age departs:

Let who will sing the truths it taught,
The marvels wrought:

Me rather shall its sinful years
But move to team,

As in a backward glauce I see
Its infamy.

Shall blood of men be my lament,

Or sceptres rent,
Or Vatican's deal· citadel
Besieged of hen?

The glory, Rome, that crowned thy brev,
Where is it now ?
of old, all natione loved in thee

Thy Pontiff's See.
