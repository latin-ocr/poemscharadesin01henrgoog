POEMS

Ο godless laws, count up your gains ε
What truth remains ’ἶ

Α shrineless J ustice, lo! it stands
On shifting sands.

’ Hark ye the new hierophant

of Science, chant

His song to Nature's soulless clod
As to a godi

And yet Man's birthright from on high
He will deny,

And search to find a single root
For Man and Brute.

O to what hideous depth is hurled
The prend, proud world!

Kneel, then, Ο morta] man, to God,
And kiss His rod. ’

Him only, Truth, and Life, and Way,
Learn to obey,

Who only, through the fleeting years,
Can dry thy tears.

The pilgrim hosts to Peter' s shrine
His Hand divine
But now hath led—a portent viewed

of Faith renewed.
