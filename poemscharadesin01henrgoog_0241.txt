POEMS

J mue, Who on Thy throne sublime
Shalt judge all time,

Make the rebellione will obey
Thy sovereign away:

Scatter the seeds of gentle peace
'riu war shall cease;

And to their native hell exile
Tumult and guile:

One dream let hearte of kings pursue—
Thy Will to do 3

One Shepherd let the earth behold,
One F aith, one Fold.

Long ninety years my course is run—
Thy Will be done:

My prayers the erowning grace to gain,
Be not in vain!
