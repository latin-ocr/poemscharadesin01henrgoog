POEMS

THE EVE OF CHRISTMAS
(1901)

GOMETH the yearly Feast‚ the wondrous Holy Night,
Worthy of sacred hymn and solemn rito.

No harbingers of joy the olden message sing,
Nor gifts of Peace to waiting mortals bring.

Alone the thronging hosts of evil men I hear,
And see the anxious brow and falling tear.

The Age will bear no yoke3 forgets the God above,
Nor duteous payment yields to parents' love.

Suspicione Discord rends the peaoeful State in twain,
And busy Murder follows in her train.

Gono are the loyal saith, the rights revorod of old—
Reigns but a. blind and cruel lust of Goldl

Ο coms, Thou holy Caum! Pity the fallen world,

Lest it should pei-ish, into darkness hurled.
