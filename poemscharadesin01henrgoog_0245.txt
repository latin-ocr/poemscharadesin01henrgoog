Pomm

Out of the laboring Night grant it a newer birth, -
And a Now Age to bloom o'er all the earth.

Circle with splendore old the brow of Faith divium
Let her full glory on the natione shine.

Nerve her to battlings new ; palsy her foas with dread3
Plaoe the victorious laurel on her head.

Be Error's mist dissolvffl, and ancient feuda repressed,
'l’ill Earth at last find quietudo and rest.

Ο gentle Pence, return, nor evermore depart3
And link us hand in hand and beart to beart!
