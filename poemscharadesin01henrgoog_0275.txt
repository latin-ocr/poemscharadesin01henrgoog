NOTES

AD VINCENTIUM PAVANIUM (p. 2).

“ Ever since the school-boy of Viterbo has become the teacher of
the Christian world, European and American scholare have been
able to admire and praise the classic taste and exquisite finish of the
productioris of his pen, in prose and verse. He gave early promise
of uncommon literar-y distinction. Just as he had completed his
