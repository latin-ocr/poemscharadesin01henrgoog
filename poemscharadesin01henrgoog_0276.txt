near the little chapel is the Pope’s breakfast-mom. It is simple
enough in all conscience. And what is the breakfast? A cup 01
black coffee with a small roll 01 bread. Nothing more. And now
the breakfast is ended and the Pope withdraws to his private study‚
where his enormous correspondence and his secretaries are waiting
