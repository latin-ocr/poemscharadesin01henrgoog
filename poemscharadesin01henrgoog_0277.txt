Scripture and the brief record of the lise of the saint of the day.
Aster examination of conscience and night prayers, the aged Pope is
supposed to retire and to rest. . . . But does he never break in upon
his rest? Too frequently, they say. His magnificent encyclieah,
his consistorial allocutione, his addresses to pilgrimo, deputatione
and societies, his most important bulls or constitutions, like those 011
