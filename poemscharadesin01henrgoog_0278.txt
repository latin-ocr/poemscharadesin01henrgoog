NOTES

Boin. οω9.), shows clearly how far Mommsen erred in his interpre-
tation. The ancellum os Janns probably lay between the Forum
Romanum and the Forum J ulii. The English translation fol·
low-8, os course, the erroneous implioetion, or rather statement, os
the Italian origina13 and the correction has been relegated to this

The Charade also assumes that in the three amendes or Jani re-
ferred to by Horace, statues of the god had been set up. The Eng-
lish translation of the Charade follows the implieution of the Italian
original, although the more recent view refers the Janoe cunutus,
medius and imus ω three arches near the Forum. The Cha-nde
would lead one to infer that the “piu simulant-W was based on
Foroellini‚ who is given as an authority in the suot-note. Fomellini,
however, considers Janus to be the name os a street, eo called either
because οἷο, temple or image of the god, or of three arcades it poe-
sensed (ιι-ὣω Jam'z perviis). He then continues: Prima. hujus vici
pars, ubi pecunia fenori dabatur, summus Jamw, ultima imus, media
medius Janua vocabatur. And he adduces the illustratione from

Horace in support os this interpretation.

CANESTRO (p. 16).

The chan-ade is addressed to Silvia. In the opening words of
Shakespeare’s Song (⁴⁸ Two Gentlemen of Verona,'' Aet IV. , se. 11 )‚

we may ask:
Who iz Silvia? what 1⁸ she.
'rhet all our mains commend her?

That Shakespeare’s Silvia is meant might readily beinserred smm
the similarity os the praises awarded her by the Chai-ade:

Ο delle donne italiche,
Silvia. decoro e vento.

which aooord wel! with the third etanta os Shakespeare’s Song:

'rhen to Silvia let us sing,
That Silvia is excelling:
She excels each morta! thing
Upon the dull earth dwening:
Το her let us garlanda bring.

Aa the “anglo πῖθ’ has offered gni-lande to her, the young author
will modestly tendet but “ un fiorellin poetioo'' eulled in his little

guden.
