NOTES

Or does Silvia symbolize Florence? The first four lines of the
Chat-ade seem to be but an Italian translation of Roget-s (“ Italy&
1, xx):

or all the rairest citios of the earth
None are so fair as Florence.

Or, lastly, does she typify Rome? Silvia, the mother of Romulus
in the old myth, might very well be chosen as Rome personified.
And the preeminence of Rome would make the declaration that she
is the ‘⁶ decore e vanto'' of all Italia's queenly cities nothing more
than a litera] statement of a historical sact3 for what Shakespeare
sings of his Silvia may be said as well of Rome:

Holy, sair and wiso is she.
The heaven such grace <nd lend her.
'rhet she might admired be.

Is, then, the “anglo vnte'’ Shakespeare? or is it, perchanee‚
Byron that is referred to? F rom- the preceding Chai-ade on “ Arti-
gianoss' wherein Silvia is addressed in similar fashion‚ a render

might well conclude that Silvia is Rome, and from the present
Chal-ade on “ Can-estro‚’' that the English bard is Byron.

A MoNsmNOR oRFEI (p. 22).

Many biographers of the Pope tell us of tbe really romantio con-
tests waged by the young man of twenty-seven who3 as Delegate
Apostolic in Benevento. found himself confronted with a well-
entrenched brigandage. But despite a severe sickness from which
he suffered at the outset of his official life there, and despite the har-
assing· carm besetting a reformet· in civil lise, he seems to have re-
tained a fine sense of the ludicrouS. This sense of humor is, in the
opinion of Father Faber, a saving grace. We find it charmingly
displayed in this poem (written first iu Italian and subsequently
translated by its aut-hor into Latin elegiace). It is dedicated to
Mons. Orfei, the author’s predecessor in office, who had assigned a
part of the Apostolic palace, called the Caele-llo, to the President of
the court, a certain αυυοοαεο recent-ly arrived from Lorett0. The
lawyer's name was Palomba, which is good Italian sor ‘³ ring-dove'’
or ‘⁴ νινοοᾱ-ρίςθοη.Η He came with his wife and children to take up
his residence in a house whose demure quiet had been broken only
by the lyric accomplishments of Mons. Orsei. We can easily fancy
the jarring of nerves consequent on such an invasion by noisy chil-
