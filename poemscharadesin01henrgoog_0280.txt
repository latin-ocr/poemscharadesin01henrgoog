nishedby twosueh namesasorzseiand Palombamtoogoodto
escape appropriate recognition.

The similarity of the thought of the first stanna to that of Dryden’ ο
Ode has led the present translator to borrow one line from the Eng-
liuh bord: “Sequaeious of the lyre.’' He has not felt enlled upm
in this and similar instanoes of appropriation (e. 9., the Machethian
“way to dusty death'’ in De Inmletudine Sua, and the Scriptnnl
‘⁶ poison of aspa iu under their tongue'' in Πυραία Δ. 0. Effi=onoen
Mulierem Depellit, ete. )‚ to eredit the stolen phrases to their aeva-J
obvious sources.

m MAEVIUM (p. 28).

The poem “In Mnevium '' is a pretty piece of writing‚ and not
without an obvious humor-although the allusion is not elea-r. Wn
this modern Maevius a wretched poet like him of old on whoee luck-
less head Horace, throughout his tenth Epode‚ ealle down a choico
collection of maledictione? and whom Virgil scores in his Third
Eologue:

Atque idem iungat vulpes et mulgent himen.

Or was he merely an eeoentric‘ ‘sharper'' with‘ ‘method in hi·
madness 'P' However it be, the poem is full of lise and mov‘emmt,
the pertraiture is vivid, and the whieper of the bystnnder —‘ ‘cani-

dior vulpes poll Maevius'' —is refreshingly true to nature. The
full title of the poem ie. “In Maevium, Virum Callidum etAb-

Whilst Archbishop os Perugia‚ Cardinal Peeei ns vont to have
reoourse to verse, both as a solaoe midst the eures of his office and
as a means of testifying to his affectionate remembranee os oen-tain
excellent priests who had toiled faithfully and gone to their reward.
The verses in honor of one Serafino Farodini, parish-priest of St
Elena, in playing delicately on the words of his name, make use of
what ie ordinarily a. dangerous experiment3 for where such vord-
plny happens to escape banality, it meets the danger either os un·
pleasant <triticiam or of uncritical flattery. Happily, the Binhop’o
poem ie free from all these complication83 for a note appended to it
