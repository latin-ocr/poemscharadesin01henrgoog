“When, in 1825, the Roman College solemnly inaugurated its
oourses of ecclesiastica] and secular taching, its halls were at once
filled by fonrteen hundred studente. Among these was Vincent
Peoci. . . . More remarkable still was his success in Latin verse.
The rule for all who contended here for the prim of excellence was
that they should, within the space of six hours, and without any
exter-nal aid whatever, write a certain number of Latin hexameters
on a specified subject. This subject happened to be the Feast os Bel·
ahmar. Young Pecci [then 15 years old] produced one hundred
and twenty verses of such unquestionable excellence that the prize
wns unanimously awarded to him by the judges. This, however, was
not his only success: to him were also awarded the first honors in
Greek.’' (O’Reilly.) In 1830, he was matriculated among the
Divinity studente of the Gregorian University, his Alma Mater.
Father Manem, mentioued so lovingly in the poem, was Prefect of
Studies, and had founded an Academia for the theological studente.
“ To give this academy a firm standing in the public opinion of the
university, two solemn disputations were held in the university hall.
. . . The person chosen on both occasions to expose the doctrines
of Revelntion and to detect and resute all possible objections was
Peoci.” After his course in the university, he studied law and
diplomacy at the Academy of Noble Ecclesiastics. Cardinal Sala,
who is referred to with such great affection in the poem, was a ven-
erable man “who had been associated with Cardinal Caprara in the
disastrous legation to Paris in 1808, and whose soul had been tried.
like that of Pius VH himself, by the six terrible years that sol-
lowed.'' He had “conceived a warm attachment for Pecci. In
their intercourse the young and inexperienced churchman learned,
from one who had been thrice purified in the fornace, many lessons
which were soon to be of priceless service to himself in governing
men and dealing with governments.'' (O'Reilly).
