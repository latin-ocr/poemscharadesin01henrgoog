While we may not venture on such an undertaking, the poem
surely invites to a closer and fuller knowledge of the Pope’s life and
wonderfully frnitful activity. That life does not lack romantio aa
well as instructive details. In illustration, we quote from the L¹Y⁶
os Leo the Thirtoentlz, edited by John Oldcastle (Wilsred Meynell).
The incident quoted may serve as a part of the abundant commen·
tary on the lines of the poem:

Dulcia Parthenope, Beneventum dein tenet, aeque
Ut lege Hirpinos imperioque regas.

were overhauled and their administration subjected to a searching
examination. They were compelled to meet every poecise charge
that any os the pensantry chose to make against them. The ac·
cuser and the accused were brought face to sace and their evidence
