NOTES

Rome of the Delegate’s manner of procedure . . . But Pope Greg-
ory refused to move or to interfere in any way. He had deliber-
ately and with open eyes chosen his man and was determined to
trust him . . . Consequently the Delegate was left with a free hand
ιο work out the problem in his own way.’ A number of stories,
more or less to the point, are told to illustrate the energy and the
impartiality with which he carried out his operations against the
brigands, who seem ιο have terrorized the population and to have
secured for themselves friends in high places. A certain noble, on
whose movements invidious watch had been kept, came one day to
the Delegate in afit of injured innocence, threateniug ιο go ιο Rome
to bring his complaints before a higher tribuual:

‘Have you given the matter enough thought?' asked the Dele-
gate quietly.

‘ Certainly,' said the Marquis.

‘ 1 don't agree with you,' replied Monsiguor. ‘ In these matters
one cannot reflect too much, and you will therefore favor me by re-
maining here as my prisoner!

That night the noble's castle was surrounded, aud twenty-eight
brigands who enjoyed its protectiou were either slain or secured.’'

All of the above illustrates prettily the rather dry statement of the

poem:
⁸⁸ Benevento sees
Thy Hirpine rule observo all equities! ’⁹

astical seminaries have a curriculum usually of ten years, and are
divided into two institutions—the Preparatory or “ little'' and the
Higher or “great'' seminary. In Italy, however, the compara-
tively small dioceses do not permit of such a division3 as Mgr. de
T’Serclaes remarks (Vol. 1., p. 150), they are usually under the
necessity “¹ de concentrer dans un seul etablissement le cours complet
