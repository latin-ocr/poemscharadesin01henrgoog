1883 (Prota-dono, pp. 77—8): “It happened one day (what the
reason was Ι recall not) that I was late in getting ιο my clamos
literature. Knowing that 1 might chance to meet the Cardinal‚
who was watchful over the silence and order os the place, in the
corridum os the seminary, I reached the door of my class-mom with
some haste and anxiety, as you may well imagine. What was my
surprise, on entering the room with great briskness and amurance,
to see the Cardinal, whose presence Ι did not suspect, sested in my
chair and translating ιο my delighted pupils a passage os Cicero’s
Oratio pro Milone, and expounding with the greatest elegance and
taste the beanties hidden in the tongue of the Roman orator. You
can imagine, gentlemen‚ my bewilderment. Collecting my wite, Ι
sat down on the benches with my pupils, and begged the Cardinal
to continue the lesson he had begun. But leaving the obsit, he

HYMNUS IN S. HERCULANUM (p. 76.)

The hymn has been very highly praised by several competent
critice. Taking as its subject a Patron os Perugia. a martyred
Bishop of the early ages of Christianity‚ it appealed with special
force to the interest and admiration of Cardinal Pecci's diocese.
Perhaps its greatest admirer was Bishop Rotelli‚ to whom one of the
longer poems in this collection (p. 52) is dedicated. From his ap-
preciative criticism (written in 1881) we leam that he considers the
three poems in honor of St. Herculanus and St. Constantius (⁴⁸ miei
santi vescovi e martiri perugini”) “ three magnificent poema. truly
worthy os the dignity of the Pope.” He “read and re-read them,
analyzed them, elaborated them into prose, subjected them ιο a hun·
dred searching tests,'' and found them so untoucbed by the sever-est
criticism as to lead him to the conclusion that their author was
“veramente un innografo somm0.'' They recall the golden age of
