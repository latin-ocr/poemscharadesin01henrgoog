tion. They seem to declare that he was executed in prison, and
that Larianus, hiding in the shadow of its walls, awaited a favor-able
opportunity to take the body away.

The Bollandists (Acta Sana„ Jan., T. 11.) have three lives of
the Saint- All of these give the highway as the place of his
martyrdom‚ which resulted not from any legal process, but from the
superstitious sears of the soldiery who were conducting him to
Spoleto. He had been seized thrice‚ and now being led from prison
in Amisi, passed with his guard through Spello (Hispellum). This
town lies distant about three miles from Foligno. Somewhere be-
tween the two places he was martyred. Here one of the soldiers
said: ‘⁶ Ne iste magus quem trahimus suis nos artibus interficiat in-
terimatur . . . Illico vibrato gladio abstulerunt caput eius3 corpore
vero dimisso in tramite qui dicitur Fulgineato’' (op. cit„ p. 930).
Another Vita has this: “ Venerunt itaque in trivio Fulgineato, non
longe a civitate ipsa . . . et decollaverunt eum, et dereliquerunt
corpus eius in ipso loco'' (p. 928). A foot-note remarks: ⁸⁶ Describit
hunc locum Ludovicus Iacobillius de S. Fulginatibus pag. 3453
traditque agrum vicinum vocari etiamnum la Contrada di S. Con-
stanzo).” The third Vita has: ‘⁴ Cum igitur ad trivium quoddam
Fulgineatum quod vocant, non procul ab ipsa urbe Fulginea posi-
tum, noctu pervenissent . . . strictis gladiis in hominis iugulum
invadunt’' (p. 935). All of these accounts seem to imply not a
prison but a highway.

But the stanzas offer another difficulty. What is the meaning of
luco pauc-mi? Is it the twilight of the dying, or of the beginning
day? Brunelli‚ one of the first translatore, does not specify:

Giace nel sangne esanime tua spogna:
Ma vigilando Levian pietoso,
Dell oscuro tuo earcere la soglia

Di varear oso.

Per la queta raccoglie embra notturna
La membra sparte.

The “queta ombra notturna '' would serve either hypothesis, and
can scarce be aoeounted a rendering of luce pallenti. But all the
“lives” speak of Levianus as having been warned in sleep by an
angel. The twilight is therefore that of the dawning day. Bishop
Rotelli, in his estimate of the poem, understands the wan light of
the prison itself z “ la pallida e incerta luce del carcere nel quale entra
il coraggioso Leviano-Luce pauenti viqilam ad umbraml’
