NOTES

illustrated both by the moral contained in each os these hymns, and
by the words of Leo XIII. when establishing a Pious Association in
honor of the Holy Family. The special devotion is meant to meet
a special need ε “ Every one is aware,'’ says the Holy Father in his
Apostolic Letter, ‘⁶ that the prosperity and happiness of public and
private life depende most largely on the home. For the deeper the
roots of virtue strike into that soil, and the more alert parents are,
by word and doed, to inform the souls of the young with the pre-
cepts of religion, the more plentisul are the fruits resulting to the
good of society in general. It is of the highest importance, there-
fore, not merely that domestic society should be constituted holily,
but as well that it should be governed by holy rules; and that a
religious spirit and a Christian lise should be diligently and con·
stantly nourished in it. Therefore it was that the mcrciful God,
when He had decreed to perfect the work os Redemption which the
ages had so long awaited, so ordered the work that its first begin-
nings should exhibit an august model os a Family divinely consti·
tuted, in which all men might see an exemplar of every virtue and
holiness. Such a Family was that at Nazareth, in which the Suu of
J ustice, ere He should shine with full radiance on all the nations,
was first hidden; and this Family comprised Christ, the Lord God,
together with His Virgin Mother, and her most holy sponse J oseph,
who was to be the foster-father of Jesus . . . And so all fatheis
may see in Joseph a splendid norm of parental watchfulness and
care; mothers may perceive in the most holy Mother os God an
admirable illustration of love, modesty, obedience and perfect saith·
fulness3 and children have in Jeme, Who ‘was subject to them,' a
divine model of obedience which they should admire, worship, and
imitate.'’ These lessons of domestic government are but an elabo-
ration of the words of St. Paul (in his Epistle to the Colossians)
which form a part os the ‘⁶ second Lesson’' of the Office for this
Feast: ‘⁸ Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it behooveth, in the
Lord. IIusbands, love your wives, and be not harsh towards them.
Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is well ples-sing
to the Lord.''

These are the thoughts and principles inculcated by the Holy
Father in the hymns. We can not pass by.without special notice
the beautiful moral contained in one of the last stanzas of the hymn
sor Matins:
