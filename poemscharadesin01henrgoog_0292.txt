Ο Blessed Three! who felt the sung
of want and toll and suffering.
Pity the needy and obscure

Lot of the poor.

In his Apostolie Letter, the Pope ealls attention to the unrest of
the workingmen of to-day. In an Eneyelioel dealing with this mat-
ter, he has shown his deep sympathy with their οπεος but whm, or
in whatever degree, an enlightened agitation fails of its purpose, he
reminds them of the heavenly sanction given especially to their toila
and needs: “If workingmen,” he says in his letter from which I
have been quoting, “ and all those wh0, especially in our times, feel
grievously afflicted at their humble condition and the straitened cir-
cumstances of those dependent on them, will but glanee at the mem-
bers of the Holy FamHy, there will not be wanting reasons why they
should rather rejoiee than be grieved at their lot. They share with
that sacred Family in toil and in the eures of daily life3 J oeeph was
bound to provide for its subsistence from the weges of his laben nay,
even the hands of the God-Man were exercised in a workshop.''

This is the leeson of eontentment to be derived from a contempla·
tion of the House os Nazareth. But another lesson may be found
equally suitable for those who are bleesed by fortune. The Holy
Father prays the sacred Three to

Banish the ‘⁴ pride of life'’ from all
whom ampler wealth and Joys berall.

And this is but a poetieal version of his own words in the Letter:
²⁶ Qui nobiles nati sunt, discent a Familia regii sanguinis quomodo
et in edita fortuna se temperent, et in afflicta retineant dignitatem:
qui dites noscent ab ea quantum sint virtutibus posthabendae divi-
tiae.” The noble are reminded of the royal blood of that lowly
Household3 and the wealthy.¹ that virtue is to be preferred to richen.
Thus this devotion to the Holy Family includes in its scope the ex-
tremeet statione of life—poverty and lowlinees, wealth and nobility.
These lessons are sorely needed in our times; and the hymns, like
the Feast whose offioe they serve to adom, while they are indeed ex-
quisite in their Christian thought and classic phrase, possess even a
higher value as prayers than as poems.

While many a Pope has been literally a “ Pontifex Maximna,”
the long line of the Papacy has splendidly preserved the architec-
