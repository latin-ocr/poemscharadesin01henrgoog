The second, and much longer poem:

Difficilem cursum. longosque emensa viarum
Trecms, carpineta huc feror unda iugis . . .

appears to be an emendation and elaboration of a shorter, but very

beautiful, poem on the same theme. It should prove interesting to
‚give it here in its original form:

Fons Loomrun.
Leniter exiliens pandulphi e colle superno,
Huc e nativis deferor unda iugis.

Nam qui romani Ionehimus Peeeius ostri
Primus nutele hoc auxit honore solum.

Per eseeos terrae, plumbo ducente. meatus
Oblitam patriae me iubet ine viam.

Improvise quidem, sed gratior advena vobis
mtto, municipes, eandida, inempta fluo.

Huc ergo, properate: adsum nam sam-e saluti.
Munditias, vitaeque usibus et caenida.

On Pendulph’s hm 1 brokez

For ptem, who in Roman purple elad
His natal soil makes glad.

Heth led me nither, mindless ot my birth.
Through derkest ways of earth.

More weleome am Ι, cm, ns unroreseeu,

Comei Ι am dedicate to elesnly hauath.
To poverty, to wealth!

It may well be doubted if the pleasant simplieity and direetness
os this previous poem have not disappeared somewhat in the pomp
and circumstance of its elaborated emendation. It is, we think, nn
exquisite idea exquisita-ly eal-ried out. The technique is worth] of
the inspiration. A foot-note attached to it (in the edition of the
camina published in 1883) remarks: ‘⁴ Aquam saluberrimi haustus
Carpinetum adducendam curavit an. MDOCCLXIV.”
