infancy‚ he had cherished towards the Blessed Virgin; and ιο the
fact that, as years passed, he beheld more clearly the love and honor
which are due ιο her ‘⁴ whom God was the first to love and to favor,
γοα, ιο love in such wise that she was the one whom, elevated above
all the rest of creation and adorned with amplest gifts, He chose to
be His Mother.'' His words are so beautiful in themselves, and
serve so well ιο introduce his poems entitled Flami (“ little flow-
ers ’' ), that space is made here for a brief quotation: “ Magnae Dei
Matris amorem et cultum quoties ex occasione liceat excitare in
christiano populo et augere, toties Nos mirifica voluptate et laetitia
perfundimur, tanquam de ea re quae non solum per se ipsa praestan-
tissima est multisque modis frugifera, sed etiam cum intimo animi
Nostri sensu suavissime concinit. Sancta nimirum erga Mariam
pietas, semel ut paene cum lacte suximus, crescente aetate, succrevit
alacris valuitque in animo firmius: eo namque illustrius menti ap-
parebat quanto illa esset et amore et honore digna, quam Deus ipse
amavit et dilexit primuS, atque ita dilexit, ut unam ex universitate
rerum sublimius evectam amplissimisque ornatam muneribus sibi

adjunxerit matrem.’'
PARAPHRASES.

Throughout the Paraphrases the Pope plays on the word
“Rosaryss’ comparing the devotion now ιο a hasket of flowers
offered at the shrine of the Blessed virgin, now ιο ει wreath cf
reses, a chaplet‚ a crona, etc, woven for the brow of the heavenly
“Queen of the May.’' How the devotion came to be styled the
“Rosary ’³ is a matter os dispute amongst the learned. The cml·-
olic Dictionary of Addis and Arnold remarks: ‘⁴ The original meen-
ing is very doubtful. We think it most likely that the word was
used in a mystical sense and meant Mary’s rose-garden. (So the
writer of the article Rosmkranz in Herzog, ‘ Encycl. fiir Protestant.
TheoL’ )'' Not an unlikely hypothesis, whose mystica] siguificance
might have been further illustrated by the title οἱ* ‘Rosa Mystioe”
in the Litany of LorettO, and the‘ ‘Rose of Sharon'' as a poetical
appellation. The words with which Wisdom exalte herself are
applied mystically ιο the Blessed Virginz‘ ‘1 was exalted . . . as
a rose-plant in Jericho’' (Eccl. xxiv. 18). In somewhat similar
fashion, attribution is made of the glory of Simon the high-priest
(ib. 1. 8): “as the flower of roses (flos rooerum) in the days cf
spring‚'' and the praise of the just (ia, xxxix. l'a’): ⁸⁶ as the roae
planted by the brooks of vatem.”
