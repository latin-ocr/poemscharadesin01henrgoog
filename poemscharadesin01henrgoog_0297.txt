NOTES

In the Pau-aphram the Rosary is also called “sertum,'' “rosea
corolla.'' Anciently it was styled ·‘ Psalterium Marianum,'' in
imitation of the 150 Psalms. Alanus Rupensis assigna five reasons
why it should be called Psalterium rather than Rosarium, Corona,
or Sertum. His second argument is: “ Secundo, vocabula conclu,
noemma, siarum metaphorica sunt, ex similitudine dicta3 psal·
terium vero a psallendis Deo laudibus nomen habens, proprie est
oratio* (apud Acta Sama, Aug„ T. 1., p. 423, where an elaborate
historical treatment of the devotion is given, pp. 422-437 ).

The first line of the fourth Paraphrase mentions the name of
Gusman, i. a, St. Dominio, who, about the year 1208, is said to
have introduced the Rosary in its present form. He was born, in
1170, at Callaruega (Calahorra, in Old Castae), of the powerful
house of Gusman.

In the following poem, “Adiutrici Christianorum‚'' he is re·
fel-red to:

Adfluit at virgo: meritis, pletate verendum
Flnibus hispanis advocat ipsa Virum.

ADIUTRICI CHRISTIANORUM—ELEGIA.

The title “ Help of Christians'' (Auxilium Christianorum) was
inserted in the Litany of Loretto by St. Pius V., aster the marvel-
ous victory of Lepanto. In his devotional and historical treatment
of this Tine, Barthe (Limnias, etc„ pp. 185-7) gives a number of
illustratione of the heavenly protection afforded by the Blessed
Virgin. Amongst them he cites that of Pius VII. over Napoleon,
a moral victory which is commemorated hy a special Feast ordered
by that Pontiff to be celebrated on the 24th of May (the day of his
entry into Rome), in honor of the Auxilium Christianorum.

Leo XIII. cites in his poem two illustrious instances os the help
of the Blessed Vir-gin, namely‚ the labora os St. Dominic in spread-
ing the devotion of the Rosary among the Albigenses, and the
splendid victory of the Christian fleet over the Turks near the
Echinades islands. Lines 5-18 celebrate the former3 lines 19-54
the latter.

Besides the vindication of St. Dominic made by Lacordaire, a
very excellent biography by Archbishop Alemany tells with great
clearness and moderation the part taken hy him in the matter of the
Albigenses. This is not, however, the place to enter upon hotly
dispuoed mattam and the allusion to St. Dominic suggests merely
