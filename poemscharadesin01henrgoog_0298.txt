NOTES

an interesting quotation illustrative of the poem: ‘Vl'here remeius
yet one more particular to be mentioned about the Albigenaes . . .
that the beautiful devotion of the Rosary began at this time, and
owes its origin to this very heresy. TheAEomm is, as you know, in
an especial manner, a devotion in honor of our Lord’s Incarnation;
and I have already told you that the Albigenses denied this doctrine.
They believed that our bodies and all matter were evil; they could
not believe, therefore, that the Son of an all-good and all-holy God
had taken upon himself a material body of flesh and blood like unto
curs. They chose rather to say that He had taken only the semb-
lance, or appearance, of a human body; so that He had not really
been born of the Blessed Virgin Mary, nor really died upon the
Cross, nor really risen from the dead, nor really ascended into
heaven. When, therefore, the holy St. Dominio came to labor
among these miserable heretice, and wished both to reclaim those
who had been already deceived‚ and to confirm in the true saith
those souls that had not yet been corrupted, he instituted this form
of prayer, in which the whole history of our Lord's life. paoeion,
and resurrection, is brought before our mindS, to be thought about
and meditated upon in prayer by means of what are called the joy-
ful, sorrowful‚ and glorious myster-ies. I do not mean to say but
that the practices of frequently reciting our Father and the Hail
Mary, and of counting the number of prayers by means of stones,
beads, or other such marka, were far more ancient than the days of
St. Dominic; but the union of these two practices in that particular
form which we still use, and which we call the Roeary, was certainly
first made by him, and for the purpose we have mentioned, viz,
deeply to impress upon the minda and hear-ts of the people the great
fundamental truth of Christianity, ⁸ God made man) It was, in
fact, an abridgment of the whole Gospel history—the aum and sub-
stance of the Gospel put into a short and simple form, which even
the poorest and most ignorant could frequently repeat and easily re—
member: nor can we doubt that it was by a special inspiration from
heaven that St. Dominio was led to establish a devotion which has
become so universal in the Church, and which has been eo abund-
antly blessed to the instruction and salvation of souls'’ (points os
Hirtam, p. 99).

It is but proper to say that the ascription to St. Dominio of the
institution of the Roeary, and of the practice of meditating on the
Mysteries during its recitation, have been questioned by Catholic
