writers. A very elaborate discussion of these questions may be
found in the Acta Sanctorum (Aug, T. Ι. ). In quoting as we have

judgment on the questions in dispute, but have endeavored merely
to make the historical allusione clear.

The second instance of the assistance rendered by the Blessed
Virgin, namely, at the battle of Lepant0, is worthy of greater space
than may be accon-ded it in our comments. The battle deserves to
be ranked among the decisive battles of the world. It “ari-ested
forever the danger of Mahometan invasion in the south of Europe,’'
says Alison. St. Pius V„ of whom Ranke has lest us such a glow-
ing portrait‚ was then in the Chair of Peter (1571). ‘⁶ It is not to
be supposed,” says Cardinal Newman (The Purks, iii, ἑ 6), “ that
a Saint on whom lay the ‘solicitude of all the churches,’ should
