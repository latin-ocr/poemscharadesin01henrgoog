NOTES

a fast of three days was proclaimed for the ficet, beginning with the
Nativity of our Lady (Sept. 8) . . . At length, on the seventh of
October, they found the Turkish fleet half way between Lepanto and
the Echinades on the North, and Patras, iu the Morea, on the South.
. . . The night before the battle, and the day itseli', aged aa he
was, and broken with a cruel malady, the Saint had passed in the
Vatican in fasting and prayer. All through the Holy City the
monasteries and the colleg-es were in prayer alsa As the evening
advanced the pontifics] treasurer asked an audience of the Sovereign
Pontiff on an important matter. Pius was in his bedroom, and bt»
gan to converse with him, when suddenly he stopped the conversa·
tion, left him, threw open the window and gazed up into heaven.
Then closing itagain, he looked gravely at his official, and said³
⁸ This is no time for business3 gn, return thanks to the Lord God„
In this very hour our fleet has engaged the Turks, and is victoriom’
As the treasurer went out, he saw him sall on his kneae before the
altar in thankfulness and joy. And a most memorable victory it
was: upwards of 30‚000 Tui-ks are said to have lost their lives in the
engagement, and 3,500 were made prisonem. Almost their whole
fleet was taken. 1 quote from Protestant authorities when 1 say
that the Sultan‚ on the news of the calamity, neither ate, nor drank,
nor showed himself, nor saw any one for three days; that it was the
greatest blow which the Ottomans had had since Timour's victory
over Bajazet, a century and a half before; nay, that it was the turn-
ing-point in the Turkish history, and that, though the Sultans have
had isolated successes since, yet srom that day they undeniably and
constantly declined3 that they have lost their prestiyc and their sels-
oonfidence‚ and that the vietor-ies gained over them since are but the
complements and reverberations os the overthrow at Iepantoss’

The Breviary, in the 5th Lesson of the F east (Fest. SS. Rosa-ii)
associates this victory with the Rosary: “ Nam cum illa ἱρῇ die
victoria relata sit, qua die sanctissimi Rosarii sodalitates per univer·
sum orbem consuetas supplicationes peragerent, statutusque preces
de more funderent, iis precibus haud immerito refertur accepta.”

The poem recalls the prophetie promise of victory, made by Pius

to his admit-al:
Mirum ex hoste triumphum
Fatidice edixit praescium ore Pius.

Rohrbaeher refers to this in his history (Vol. 12, p. 739): ‘⁵ 11
