ored by the Emperor Leopold and by Bonaparte)—nevertheleoe he
was as poor at the end of his career as at its commencement:

Pan-la, magne senex, te Insubris vidit egentem-

but his renown has survived his death, and is being more and more
vindicated by the cooler judgrnent of to-day. The Pope is quite
within the bounds of accuracy:

Vindex posteritas te supra astra locat.

Alfieri created a new era os tragedy iu Italy3 and after discovering
his tulerit, labored most energetically‚ producing fourteen tragedies
in seven years. He also translated some plays of Aeschylus, Sopho·

Visus, qui tragicum spirans, e littore graio
Ausoniis Sophoclea mente animoque refers.

The London Tablet (Jan. 13, 1900) contained this comment on
Parim, without mention of Metastasio or Alfieri:
“The following distichs have been composed by His Holiness

quite recently in memory of Giuseppe Parini:

're ne ego sublimi sileam metuende flagello
Carmine saepe ausum grandia pindarico ’ἲ

Patria, magne senex, te Insubria vidit egentem
Vindex posteritas te super astra locat.

“The temperament of Parini differed widely from that of Leo
XIII ; his was acrid, violent, unsparing; the Pope's is exactly the
reverse. But both are shown to have many points of resemblance
when we remember that, leaving the poets of North Europe out of
count for the sake of argument, Parini was probably the greatest
satir-ist since the days of Juvenal, though possessed of qualities which
made him resemble both Virgil and Horace, as the Cardinal Vice-
Ohancellor has shown in an eloquent discourse. In a double way,
therefore, he resembles the poet-Pope, who has celebrated him in

vem Patria, magne senex. te Insubris. vidit egentem.

zinga Leo xm.

La mia povera madre non ha pane
Le non da me, ed io non ho datiaro
Da mantenerla almeno per domane.”

sings Parini himself.
