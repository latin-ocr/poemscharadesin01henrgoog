thing of the enthusiastie view of this event taken by 911 embolim,
and especially by 911 Catholie Freneh hem-ts, we must leave the
desieented narratives of modern historiam and hie ns back to St.
Gregory of Tours, to Aleuin and to Hinemar. Guizot (Me'mot‘m
eur PHistoire de Franco, T. 1., p. viii) remarks that: ‘⁶ De tous les
monumens qu'il nous 9 transmis sur 99 1093 91 sombre 911908, 19 plus
important est, 9 eoup sar, l'histoire eedboiatiqtoe des Franes de
Gregoire de Tours3 titre singulier et qui revele le secret de'l’etat
809191 9 cette epoque. Ce n’est pas l'histoire distinete de l'Eglise,
ce n'est pas non plus l'histoire civile et politique seule qu's. vouln
retraeer l’ecrivain3 l’une et l'autre se sont ofl'ertes en meme temps 9
89 pensee, et tellement unies qu' il n'a pas ern ponvoir les separer.
Le elerge et les Franoe, e’etait 91018 en effet toute 19 sociem, 19 seule
du moins qui prit part vraiement aux evenemens et pot pretendre ὃ,
une histoire.” Guizot seems to find fault with this neatment, sinee
119 continues: “ Le reste de la population vivait et mourait miser-hle,
innotis, 139019.” I shall not pause to quarrel with his implied criti-
cism, but shall merely eall attention ιο 1119 fact which he 813991188
namely, that to St. Gregory’ s mind, Franee and its religion were to
be inseparable eompanions; that, ιο 1119 French mind, Gesta Dei per
Francos was not merely 9 9111091919, but 98 well 9 symbolism3 and
that, for its war-cry, Franee took the words Nod l Neci! and thus
recalled the Christmas night os the year 476, when Franee, in 1119
baptism of Clovis‚ became the ‘⁶ eldest daughter of 1119 Church.‘’ A
11911011 was born on the natal day of Christ the Saviour. The oldest
narratives of the baptism of Clovis are redolent of this interfusion of
religione and 99110991 aspiratione. And it 18 901 strange 11191 the
14111 9991911917 of the event should have moved the Pope ιο write 9
poem summarizing the grand story of Franee into 9 condensed
Gesta Dei.
