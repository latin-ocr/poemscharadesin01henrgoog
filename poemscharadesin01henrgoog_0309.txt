summarized in the third stanna of the poem. Hincmar, in his Life
of St. Remigius (c. 24), introduces Aurelian as speaking to the king
in almost the same words as the poem: “ Domine mi rex, crede
modo Deum coeli quem domina mea regina praedicat, et dabit tibi
ipse rex regum et Deus coeli atque terrae victoriam.'’

Remis le manet infulata fronte sacer-doa—At the requoet of Clotilda,
St. Remigius (Remi), bishop of Rheims‚ began ιο instruct Clovis in
Christianity. Several bishops, including those of Chartres and
Soissons, together with many priests, joined-in this apostolatc which
had sor its catechumene a whole army. Finally the great day of
baptismal regeneration was at hand (Christmas‚ 496). St. Gregory
of Tours and Hincmar have left us glowing descriptione of the cere-
mony‚ which have been pleasingly condensed by Darrus (Eng-
transl.): “The baptismal fonts of St. Martin's‚ the great church of
Rheims, were magnificently adorned3 the nave was decorated with
white hangings3 the same emblematic color also appeared in the
dress of Clovis and the other catechumene chosen from among the
flower of the Salians. On Christmas night (A. D. 476), all the
streets were tapestried from the king’s palace to the basilica3 the
church blazed with a thousand fires shed from richly persumed
tapers. The procession moved on towards the basilien, preceded by
the Cross and the book of Gospels borne in state. St, Remigius led
the king by the hand3 they were followed by queen Clotilda‚ and
the two prinoesses Albofleda and Lantilda, sisters of Clovis. Up-
ward of three thousand officere aud nobles of the court, all dressed
in white ornaments, were going to receive baptism with their king.”
These details are more summarily given in the first two paragraphs
of the letter containing the papal grant of a J ubilee (dated J an. 8,
1896). The Pope next remarks that the union of the scattered ter·
ritories of the Frankish realm was brought about rather by divine
assistance than by the civil or military exploits of Clovis3 and that
France began thenceforward to flourish and ιο merit well of Catho-
