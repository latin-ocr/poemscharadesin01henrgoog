I can not sorbeat to translate a part of the admirable Pastoral of
Card. Langenieux: ‘⁴ The year 1896 brings the fourteen hundredth
annivemary of a providential event, which has already fixed the his·
toric and religione destinies of the F rench nation, and which remains
the glory of our city of Rheims. For indeed it was not merely a
barbarian leader, but a whole people whom St. Remi baptized on
Christmas day of the year 4963 and this memorable date makes an
epoch in the history of modern times. The effecte of the conversion
of Clovis were felt in the very confines of the people of Gaul; and it
loses nothing when placed in comparison with the conversim, so
important for the Chul-ch, of Constantine, in a preceding age. It
really inaugurated in the West a new order of things3 and, by as-
suring definitely to the Franks a predominance amongst the king-
doms started in the fifth century by the invading barbarians, it gave
to the Holy See that support which was humanly indispensable if it
was to survive the destruction of the Empire and upon its ruins
build up, out of other materiaIS‚ the Christian civilization which we
now enjoy. The baptistery of Rheims has become, therefore, the
cradle of this Christian France, the first-born daughter of the
Church. She has received from Christ a special mission of devotion
to the Papacy; above all things is she honored by her service in the
apostolate of God amongst the nations. And now, my dear breth-
ren, when a nation has sor fourteen centuries lived on such an act of
faith; when it has carried in its bosom, as a clear privilege, that
original compaet which became the law of its history; when it has
been able to demonstrate, by the material evidence of facts, that the
interests of its own policy as a state have been always inseparably
blended in the world with the very interests of God3 and that, fol-
lowing the example of the elect race of biblical times, it has seen its
prosperity, with all its glories, increase or decresse in proportion as
it has been faithful or faithless ιο its mission3 it is proper, if it
should find opportunity, to recall, by prayer, thanksgiving and re-
pentanee, the far-off memory of its first days3 it is proper that it
should silence, for a time, the tumult of current affairs; that it
should look up to God, and, confronting its own image the better to
know itself‚ should read again, in the truth and splendor of its his-
tory, the divine bond that unites it to Christ.’' Concerning the
Letters sent by His Holiness, the Cardinal says: The Sovereign
Pontiff “ conjures the France of Clovis not to depart from its provi-
dential pathway3 ‘to remain faithful to its genius and its Christian
