in our text. It was sent by him ιο Caeare cantu, “the Prince of

with a Rispaeta by the avvoceto Giov. Sinistri and a translation into

Luce tibi inspergit tempora cana, Leo,

Exustae venae: sensimque extinguitur arens
Vita: suum torquet pallida mors iaculum.

Frigida funereo mox membra teguntur amictu,
Urnaque mortales colligit exuvias.

At rapidus, vinclis abruptis, explicat alas
Spiritus in coelium sidera anhelus avet-

Hoc opus, hic labor. haec longarum meta viarum:
Sancta haec cere, precor, perfice vota, Deus.

Etsi quid merui. da animam hanc in regna beata,
N amque tuus favor est, scandere Teque frui.
