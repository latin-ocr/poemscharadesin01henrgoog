NOTES

is interesting to note that the Pope answers his own quel-y: “Whenoe
this love? (Unde amm· ister)” by a Latin verse which is the equiva-
lent of

Two souls with but a. single thought,
Two hearts that beat as one.

Scilicet, he says, simale inqmimm that is, two souls with but a single
thought: and he assigns as a second reason, parilis volunta& that is,
two hearts that beat as one. We soesee could escape—nor, indeed,
wished to do so—the influence which the old thought and the old

jingle exemised in shaping the suggestion of the first stanna of the
translation.

AD FABRICIUM BUFUM (p. 216).

The text given in this volume is a revision of the Epistle as it
originally appeared. Some lines have been added, many have been
altered, and the suooession os topica has been slightly introverted.
Altogether‚ the text has been so changed as to render interesting the
following comparison of the two drafts of the poem. The first seven
lines are identieal in both poenis. The original text:

Albana e eella iubens purissima vine
Appon13 exhilarant animos curasque resolvunt

appears revised as follows:

Apponi in mensa iubeas purissima vine:
Et vacuus curis. grato praecordia potu
Demulee et recrea, convivas inter amicos.

After the next two lines the revision inserts:

Candida lympha! datum vix quidquam hoe munere maius,
Vix quidquam varios vitae magis utile in usus.

The next two lines remain unchanged‚ except that “dapes αξ*

appears as “ dapes aut.”
The next line:

Sume libens. firmandis viribus utilis esea
appears revised as:

Sume libens; toto nam firmant corpore vires.
