in the Latin text, and—doubtlaes at the expense of smoothness and
elegance—to translate as far as possible line for line.

Andrew Lang’s translation was cabled to the N ew York World.
“The Pope’s poem‚'’ he wrote by way of introduc-tion, “is on the
model of the Epistles of Horace. From the reference to coffee, he
seems to have modern manners in mind, but the ‘ banquet of greed ⁹
reflecte the intemperance of ancient Rome. The translation is neces-
sarily in the manner of the eighteenth century.” We are tempted
to quote from the “ Epistle to a Friend‚” written by the poet Rogers
“in the manner of the eighteenth century,’' and, indeed, in the
eighteenth century (it was published in 1798), the following pert-i-
nent illustration:

vain is the blaze of wealth, the pomp of power!
Lo, here, attendant on the shadowy honr,

Thy closet-supper, served by hands unseen,
Sheds, like the evening-star, its ray serene

Το hail our coming. Not a step profane

Dares, with rude sound, the cheerful rite restralm
And, while the frugal banquet glows reveal’d,
Pure and unbought—-the natives of my fleld;
While blushing fruita through scattered leaves invite.
Still clad in bloom, and vell’d ln azure lightz
With wlne, as rich in years as Homcn ningit,

With water, clear as his own fountaln flings,

The shifting side-board plays its humbler part,
Beyond the triumphs ot a Loriot's art.

The thought and even the expression of the Pope are akin to the
lines of Rogers and, like the “ Epistle'' of that English poet, are
doeigned “to illustrate the virtue of True Taste, and to show how
little she requires to secure, not only the comforts‚ but even the ele-
gancies of life’' (from the Prqfacc of Rogers).

It is inquiring rather closely into the poetical prescription of the
Pope to make his suggestions the basis of an elaborate menu. But
one eminent chef aesayed such a task. “I have read,'' 116 said,
“ Pope Leo's poem a dozen times this morning and found it—ah—
sublime. His Holiness has it right. Simple food‚ delicately pre-
pared, gives health and year-S. I am a cook, an artist, and I endorse
all that the Pope has written. . . . Give me but two hours and I
will have a menu ready—a menn fit for a prince's stomach. Pooh,
it will be easy.'' The result of his profound thinking was as
follows:
