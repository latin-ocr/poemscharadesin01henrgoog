nificanoe‚ and serves not alone to round out the poem with an ele-
gant rhetorical finish, but as well to dig-nify the whole Epistle with
a high ethical moral. The Horatian allusione or echoings of the
Epistle need not be indicated here (Cf. Epp. 1.‚ v ; Satt- 11„ iv).

The many changes indicated in the first part of this Note (pp.
306-8) will serve to illustrate how materially the revised text
differs from the original one from which Andrew Lang made his ex-
cellent translation. “ The eighteenth century style’' was singularly
well suited to the spirit of such a version. It remained‚ however,
for a fellow-countryman of his to attempt the unique experiment
of “doing'' Lang's version into Scotch. The tang of the new
idiom seems to add a spice-like ssavor to the wisc counsels of the
Epistle. Mr. J ames D. Law (born in Lumsden‚ Aberdeenshire‚
Scotland) had already published his “ Dreams o' Hame,'’ “Colum-
bia-Caledonia.'' and many other poems on Scottish and American
topics before essaying this task. Apart from the question of its ex-
cellence—and it is wholly delightful and refmmff-hn experiment
should find a place here merely as a tribute to the original of the
Pope and the version of Lang. Mr. Law has kindly permitted it to
appear in this volume for the first time in print.

Ofellus good, who understood Hippocrates lang syne,

In language plain and pleasant vein has tauld us hoo to dine.

And he has shown us not alone what evils to avoid,

But jotted doun in numbers roun’ what things may be emoyed:

What gles us health far mair than wealth man's best and greatest prlne,
And what befa’s by Nature’s lawa to a’ that gormandize.

'l'he glutton thus he scores for us in words he doesna spate

And lat’s us ken wi' ready pen the rules 0' srugal sare.
