It rapidly became a curiosity of literature for another reason.
Two distinguished men of letters concentrated their boet culture on
its translation into English. Andrew Lang' s version might well he
an original song, so little does it smell os midnight cil. And
Francis Thompson had almost poetized it into one os his own moods.
Names of lesser note are in the lengthening list; a list which would
doubtless be very formidable ιο print, were an accurate canvass ιο
be made of the current literature of other tongues than English. Ι
have not made it my concern to look up any versions but English
ones; buta hint os their existence has been furnished to me by an
attempt to render the Ode into German Alonion, which 1 find in the
Kathola'sches Kircltenblatt of Droeden, a bopy os which has been sent
to me by a friend (and poet) residing in that city!

Despite such a long list, a writer who attempts a new version
should really find some more cogent excuse than the goodliness of
the company in whose midst he sins; neither may he fairly allege
the attractiveness of the theme. Gladstone‚ it must be consessa,
achieved a task requiring the fullest contage of his convictione when
he ventured ιο publish his translations of the Odes of Horace. A
long series of poets from the lordly Milton downwards had already
essayed the high emprise. ‘⁴ why,'‘ confoesed the great statesman‚
‘⁶ why add to the number?'' Why, indeed? And Gladstone felt
himself under a gentle compulsion to answer his own query at some
length. His reasons must be those os the present writer, who also
ventures to add to the English rendering-s os the Pope's Ode. But
one of these reasons may be pleaded so justly in the present case,
that a prefatory account of it will not be inappropriate.

Gladstone thought that in translations of the Horatia-n Odes the
best faithfulness should lie in the direction of reproducing the
crystalline sparkle of the original rather than its material bulk. I
state his thought crudely, and 1 follow it but partly. It has seemed
ιο me that the thought—the essential thought—of the Pope might
be made to “pack more neatly’' (to quote a critical phrase of
Lowell' s) 111 an English stanza of much shorter syllabis length than
the original Alcaic. It may well be that Lang has done this suc-
cessfully and once sor all. None of the renderings is more eom·
pressed than his. And it may well be that the present attempt ιο
lop off four of his twenty-eight syllables has resulted in a mere jeu

⁸ Pustet has imued a collection of translations of the Ode into twelve dir·
serent tongues of continents] Europe.
