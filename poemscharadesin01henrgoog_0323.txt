NOTES

cle plume. Francis Thompson allows himself six syllables more than
Lang‚ while most of the others go even beyond this large limit.

lt will perhaps prove interesting to compare with the Aleaie orig-
inal os forty·one syllables the variously ranging lengths of the trans-
lations. As the strength os a chain is the strength only of its weak· ‘
est link, the stanza chosen here for illustration is the fifth, which
has proved a veritable crux to the translatore, and which has been
both strongly and weakly ‘⁸ done into English.''

In the original this runs:

Vae segregatis Numine legibus!
Quae lex honesti, quae superest fides?
Nutant„ semel submota ab aris,
Atque ruunt labefacta jura.

It is a eurious thing that in both os the prose translations pub·
lished‚ larger syllabis limits are found than in any of the versified
renderings—an illustration os the truth that while prose may be a
good way of saying a good thing, poetry is the best way of saying
the best thing. The Daily Ezpvw, London‚ used forty-six syl-
lables:

Woe! to all laws deprived of sacred sanction ;

What law of decorum. or what sense os honor now remains?
All institutione nod and totter to their ruin

When once removed from altars.

A contributor to Tlae Suu, New York‚ oontents himself with three
syllables less; but is not correct in translating ‘⁸ honesti'' by “good
man:’' “Alas for laws turned away from the Deityl What law,
what saith is left sor the good man? As soon as they are removed
from the altars, all laws totter and sall into ruin.''

In verse, the highest limits run but to forty syllables. The fol-
lowing is by the Rev. Father Campbell, S, J .:

111 sare the laws from which God's name's erased!
All honor perishes and mutual trust:
The nghts os Man are u-ampled in the dust;
The altar shattered—Justlee dies disgraced.

The only woman who has published a translation, as sar as I know,
is Faunis Fenton Bayne:

Woe to all laws divort-ed from sacred right!
Honor, decorum-who their bounds may tell?
Far distant from the altar's hallowed spen

All institutions rush to blackest night!
