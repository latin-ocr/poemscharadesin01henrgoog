NOTES

Four syllables less are found in the version of Father Col-mim,
S, J.. of Boston College:

Woe, woe to lawa divorced from Godl What vow
Is kept. what rule os right is left us now?
Exclude the Alta-r, and your laws

Have shattered every sacred muse.

Francis Thompson eontented himself with two syllables less than
this last example:

Alsa tor laws dissociato stom Awe!
What rests of saith, or honorable law?
Rights. from the altm- disallied.

Nod, and to min sude.

william Hayes Ward, in the Indepcndent, uses a three-lined staua,
of thirty syllables:

Woe when man’s law the law os God defles!
What raith ean stay, once from God’s altar rent!
'rhen justice saints and falls. and honor dies.

Ten syllables have thus sar been retrenohed. As the limit de-
creases, the difficulty, os course, increasoe. Andrew Lang used but
twenty-eight syllables and, with slight ambiguity os meaning, moved
with evident freedom within this “ narrow plot of ground ”2

Woe for a time of godleae lawe!
What saith, what loyalty abides?
'rom from the shrines the ancient cause
To tuin guden.

Equal limits with these were observed by the Very Rev. william
Byrne‚ V. G„ of Boston‚ in what he styled a “ Free Translata'on ”z

Ales for laws
Dissevered from the base of law divine:
What rights secure remain to me or mine.
Or God’s own cause?

The sequence of the above illustratione is logical, not chrono-
logieal. It is somewhat strange that Lang and Thompson, who were
first in the field and who were content to move within narr-ow limite,
achieving, withal, such notable success, should have been followed
by so many who either repeated οι· exceeded their limits. Perhaps
the desire for greater literalness was the motive. But has not the
Ode’s pungency been lost in the dilution os the syuabie vehiele? It
