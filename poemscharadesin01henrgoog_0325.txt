should be remarked‚ nevenheless, that this fifth staua, while it may
properly be selected as typica! of the difficulties encountered in trans-
lation, can scarcely be considered, in the translations given above, as
typical of the various successes achieved by the authors quoted. At
least in one instance, this stanza misrepresents the real triumph of
literalness found in one of the longer-limit versione. It may be dif-
fieult to retain

‘⁸ with the flash of the gem its solidity too‚’'

as Tom Moore not seldom was able to do. And there is room for
the two classes of translators3 those who aim principally at a repro-
duction of the thought in the most literal exposition possible to
patience and idiom‚ and those whose first wish is to effect the best
compromise between literalness and beauty.

The present translation attempts to preserve the thought of the
original in a still more limited stanza than that of Lang—four sylla-
bles being lopped off. It can pretend to little more than an experi—

meut in compression‚ and may serve, perhaps, to illustrate the futil-
ity of such experimenta.

was a descendant of the famous Cola da Rienzi. . . . After his
death, his son Angelo fied to Cori and there founded a family under
the name of Prosperi, as P. Sante Lauriente narrates in a chronicle
of Cori dedicated in 1631 to the guardians of Rome: ‘ Prosperi an-
tiquitus vocabantur Rientii, ex N icolao Rientio Rom. pop. tribuno'
( Vita populare anedottica del Somnio Pontefice Leone XIII. ‚ published
by the Roman review, La Palestra del &er-o).

“Anne Prosperi, countaes Pecci‚ was, in the sullest meaning os
the phrase, a strong woman. Her poi-trait, preserved at Carpinet0‚
represents 'her in an attitude at once dignified and attractive‚ and
displays the regularity of her features and the grace of her whole
person. Sweet and firm at the same time, she knew how to inspiro
her children with the virtue she herself practiced. Unceasingly oc-
cupied with their education in the first years of their childhood‚ so
important sor all the remainder of life, she produced in their hearts
