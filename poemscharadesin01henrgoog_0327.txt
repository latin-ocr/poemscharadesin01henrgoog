tradition, and more effectually sanctioned and encouraged the ven-

“ It is interesting to see such a Pope brought into contact with a
many-sided, delicately-venerable question like that os Guadalupe.
Here was authorized doctrine, but not so general and well-defined as
to bear all treatment3 and devotion enthusiastic but jealously sensi-
tive; and consideratione of public and private fitnesS, as well as of
racial and national partiality. It was never easy to legislate for
Guadulupe, least of all since Benedict XIV. gave it so high an
ecclesiastical standing. But the light, strong hand of Leo XIII.
has magically touched the sacred subject, and has beautified what
was already vesy beautiful'' (p. 32). .

Pope Mo XIII. enriched with some special additions the Office
granted by Benedict XIV. The Lessons of the Second N octurn give
a concise bnt highly-interesting narrative of the historical side of the
devotion. Father Lee furnishes a translation of these (pp. 37-39).
The Pope also wrote a beautiful Letter (pp. 35-37) and approved
the ceremony of the Coronation‚ for which he composed the Latin
verses given in our text:

“ Leo XIII. had sent his polished Latin distichs, which the dean
of the Mexican hierarchy‚ the renowned Archbishop of Guadalajara,
though in the forty-fourth year of his episcopate, undertook to inter-
pret in Spanish verse (vid. Tiempo SunL, Oct. 12, ⁹95). The lines
of these two most venet-able men have such ecclesiastical, and will
have such historic interest, that it may be well to give them here
with a sree English rendering.

“ These are the Pontiff's lines:

⁰⁸ Mexicus heic populus mira sub imagine gaudet
Te colere, alma parens. praesidioque frui.
Per te sic vigeat felix, teque auspice Christi

Immotam servet firmior usque fldem. Lm PP XIII

(Imagini augustae Mariae D. N. Guadalupensis in Mexico sub·
scribendum.)

Romae ex aedib. Vatic. die XXVI febr. an. MDcccvc.

“ En admirable imagen,
Santa Madre nuestra
El pueblo Mexicano
Gozoso te venera,
