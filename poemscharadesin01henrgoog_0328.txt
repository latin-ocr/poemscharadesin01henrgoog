”In thy portentous Picture treasured here,
The Mexic rece, Ο Gracious Mother, joys
To honor thee and reap the golden weslth
Os thy unsaning aid. In happy strength
still make it grow, that blessed by thee it hold
In ever tightening grasp the changeless Fuith of Christ ” (pp. 48. 49).

The marvellons character of the Picture3 the testimonias of Artists
who scientifically examined the texture os the cloth3 the vivid col-
oring3 the circumstances of the place, so highly unfavorable to col·
oring or texture; the remarkable state of preservationi in which it
still is—all these interesting inquiries are treated sully by Father Les
in Chapter VIII. I shall quote but one paragraph:

‘⁴ In the Brief os Benedict XIV. we find quoted these remarkable
words: ⁶ In it there is nothing that is not wonderful: a Picture from
flowers guthered in mielwinter on a soil entirely sterile and fit to
bear only thorus: on a cloth so thin that through it as through a
lanice, transennam, the temple lay easily open to the eyes: and that
aster two centuries the nitre of the neighboring lake, which erodes
silver, gold, and brasS, has notin the least injured its supreme heaut„
summam pulchritudc‘nem, nor its most vivid colors' '’ (p. 115).

GERTRUDI STERBINIAE (p. 242).

The memory of this saintly religieuse is enshrined in two Latin
elegies (the first of which appears also in an Italian version) and in
a stately Inscription (p. 242). They formed the contents of a small
but elegant volume issued by the Vnt-icen prees, and were reviewed
in the Voce della Veritiz by Professor Farabulini, from whose critique
the following details are taken. The Pope wrote them ‘⁶ in the name
of one of the most highly esteemed members of his court, the Com-
mendatore Giulio Sterbini, and dedicated them to the memory of a
decr sister of his named Barbara, who, on entering the Roman con-
vent of the Visitation Order, received the name os Gertrude. No
